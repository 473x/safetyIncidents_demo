81994,"My father in law was recently admitted to your hospital as an emergency suffering from a serious pancreatic condition. He is in his seventies and hadn't eaten for several days, so he was in a frail condition physically and mentally. I understand from my mother-in-law that the standard of care he received was appalling. Virtually no attention from doctors, and most nurses didn't seem to care about what they were doing. For example, the machine he was on broke down 30 times because it was being improperly operated, drugs were administered late or not at all and he was left for long periods with no attention at all. My Mother in Law was so appalled by the situation she felt that if he stayed in your hospital he would die. Now I realise this is second hand and it may be slightly exaggerated. He has private medical insurance and has now been transferred to a hospital where he is receiving the highest standard of care. This is a terrible state of affairs, I don't know what can be done about it but I feel those responsible should be named, shamed and punished.",1
82164,"It was bad that everything.my husband had to be readmitted again 27/9/12 as an emergency after emergency surgery sept 10 2012.he had bowel surgery that time and when he was readmitted fistulas had formed in the wound site and on recollection the doctor who discharged at that time removed staples from the scar site saying it was overcrowded but in hind site was the beginning of the fistulas forming. he was on ward 17 where for the next week was treated conservately and kept under observation. a week past with no obvious treatment. it was was obvious to the family that his condition was deteirorating.the question was asked why was he on ward 17 when ward 18 specialised in bowel problems. the next day he was moved to this ward and after speaking to the ward sister? and refered to some one who was in overall charge of the whole kit and kaboodle we were were assured everything that could be done was being done. after this my husband did appear to receive constant care and on 31/10/12 was allowed to return home fully incontinent using nappies that were completely inadequate.we coped with this situation, with district nurses attending everyday until 1/12/12 and he was taken to worcs royal hospital at our insistance and admitted as an emergency where they found the following problems that were related to his time in redditch. he had entero-enteric or entero-cutameous fistulas. pleural effusions pulmonary oadema, lobar pneumonia, uti which was E.coli positive, urethal trauma seen with blood clot as a result of a 22mm catheter trying to be forced into his urinary tract.On Tuesday 4 Dec 2012 my husband's condition became so bad he nearly died.we would like to thank the care and kindness showed to us in WRH resulting in my husband coming home 13/12/12. where he is making good progress due to the care we received from the team. god bless you.;;;,",1
82216,"It was bad that My mother had a stay in this hospital before she died of cancer . She used to tell me that some of the Nursing staff at the hematology day care department seemed seemed a little uncaring and unfriendly at times although some were really good . She also had a terrible time on the cancer ward whilst a patient there , her last days were really made miserable by some of the ward nursing staff . Again , some of the staff were really good and showed genuine care but most were disgraceful and we felt should not have been placed in a ward dealing with such a devastating illness . Bad tempered , impatient and rude nurses have no place in the Hematology dept or the cancer wards .",0
82755," I was born and lived in Sunderland all my life. I'm ashamed of my main hospital in my city. Sunderland Royal Hospital in Chester Road. The appalling treatment (Sept. 2012 ) I received from their A&E department was nothing short of - unfeeling, heartless, insensible, indifferent, cold, callous, and cruel. They seemed to have limited capabilities,nevertheless they should have cared, they did not. Be warned if the Royal Hospital treated me this way, the law of averages dictate they will treat others similarly.",0
82775, My wife came in to have earing aid adjusted on Tuesday the 8/1/13.She only wanted them adjusting because sometimes there was aloud ringing in them. They talked to my wife in a patronizing rude manner and told her she would have to wear her two earing aids which she explained she gets a lot of ear infection But kept insisting that's the way she had to wear the them and would not do it any other way Which upset my wife they just would not listen to her She told them she did not want them to treat her anymore and left the room I am also upset and angry My wife is 69 years of age she was crying when she got back to the car. Mr R SMITH,1
82907, i do not rate medway hospital at all reasons are as follows in 2000 my son was born in there i went to see my who had just given birth the door was wide open her legs in stirups and blood every where she was not covered up and people were walking past looking in such good care there in 2004 my mum had lukemia and was told if she felt ill she had to ring the hospital my wife did this because i was away with the army she was told cant help you ring back tomorrow good care again my father is in the hospital now he has been getting treatment for galdstone problems the fact he has got cancer and its bad has not recieved any treatment for this he has been in there for nearly 4 weeks ive phoned the hospital to see how he is and a cleaner picked up the phone im serving in the army at a medical regiment and have just returned from afghanistan were i was treating anything from a gunshot wound to triple amputees they got better care if things are not resolved with my father or anything happens to him my family is going to the national press and it will be another case against the hospital im unhappy with the hospital its disgusting how people get treated,1
82986," My elderly Mother was recently in the Conquest. She should have been on a medical ward, but spent nearly 3 weeks on an orthopaedic ward, not being moved untill the day after we complained. During this time she was not even helped to have her hair washed. It was very difficult to speak to anyone who was responsible for her care. One Dr even tried to discharge her to home when it was obvious she could not cope on her own. We were never involved in her discharge plan, and despite asking never saw a social worker, we found out things by accident most of the time. They had no excuse as we told them the situation and visited every day. She is now home with a lot of carers, and my sister staying (my sister lives 350 miles from her, I live 250 miles away) She is palliative care with only weeks to live, yet the Conquest were prepared to discharge her with no care plan to live alone.",1
82503,"Hello. My mother in law was in her 60s and had smoked for many years despite having asthma and developing emphysemia. She had cut down considerably, smoking e-cigarettes instead in recent months. She was admitted to hospital last month, with pneumonia in one lung, which had mostly cleared in about a week so they sent her back to her care home. The next day she was re-admitted because it had gone to her other lung. She was initially on antibiotics and the strongest oxygen mask that they had, but she refused the mask after 24 hours (because it was painful and she suffered from panic attacks) and chose a less pressured one. They said it didn't look hopeful but that they couldn't give her a sedative to help her keep the strongest mask on because it might ""send her on her way"". The antibiotics were stopped and her fluid drip not replaced. They just gave her palliative care but her lips and mouth were very dry. She hadn't eaten properly in 2 days. Her blood oxygen level showed above 80% but they said that there wasn't anything more that they could do for her. My partner stayed with his mother for 3 days watching her condition degenerate painfully. He and his relatives didn't see a dr for 2 out of those 3 days. He was told that there were only 2 drs in the hospital for the weekend and that they were focussed on the A & E department. She died a couple of days later. Should she have just been left to die, which is what seems to have happened?",1
82681,"Although there is an enquiry ongoing, and I am apprehensive to tell her story, all I will say is that my mother's pancreatic cancer was misdiagnosed on four occasions by staff at Whipps Cross accident and emergency. My mother at the time was a resident patient in a mental health unit suffering from depression and I believe her health concerns, pain, symptoms and extreme weight loss where not taken seriously and indeed have proof of her records which say she presented with petty health issues. It is a long sad story which ended in my mother losing her life in pain and distress. My faith in the hospital and indeed all the NHS departments both mental health services and medical are non existent. I worry for my family, if they should be taken seriously ill and have to attend this hospital. I myself have had bad experiences at Whipps Cross, but none have left myself and family with the feelings we have of loss, grief and memories of our wonderful mothers suffering.",1
83244," The only NHS email address visible is for complaints. The only contact seems to be phoning (often the person being called is unavailable) or post (slow, expensive and old-fashioned) to and from NHS hospitals. There is a need for modern forms of communication to be used. The NHS IT department could copy the way online banking works with ability to log on and exchange secure messages or, for now, just supply email addresses. Capture how a person prefers contact with the NHS; ask them to order preferences. e.g. secure messaging, email, text(SMS), phone(maybe more than one number), postal.",0
83686," Beautiful centre which us kept cleaned. Reception staff always friendly and honest when advising delays. Midwives vary in the level of care they offer. Some are outstanding whereas some come across as rather stressed. However, overall a kind and helpful approach is offered most of the time. I feel relaxed in QCH care as the atmosphere set is nice. The scanning team cannot be faulted, although the scans are for medical reasons; me and my husband were fully involved in the screening with the scanner explaining every test conducted. The room is very comfy with a personal screen for you to watch the whole process. Haven't had my baby yet but thinking to opt for the birthing centre do will upload a review for that separately. Good luck with your own experiences.",0
83817, Was on ward h4 was never so happy to get out and discharged myself to get out of there shure the in mates at strangeways get better treatment. One nurse alone has tantrum on corridor saying she has person in hospital and she was not intrested in hearing a person moan about toast and did not want to be there. Her family is getting better treatment where she is. Another man buzzed for a nurse and had no responce when another person went to fetch nurse for him to get bed pad it was to lat when she got there he was lay in a dirty bed.,0
83875," paramedics turned up when ambulance was called who administered gas and air, hospital sent me home at 5am, with no follow on pain killers by ambulance, i was in total pain and found the staff to be so uncaring. when someone is in so much pain and feeling so vulnerable it seems unhuman to not show any regard or help. it was a very traumatising experience and i dread having to ever return to hospital. the hospital sent me home at 5am, with only one pain killer, by ambulance. even the ambulance staff was amazed that i had been sent home so early. i was seen by a junior doctor and no registrar.",1
83803,"I was visiting my mother in ward 23 in Lancaster Infirmary as she had been admitted with having a stroke. What I witnessed in there was disgusting. My mother was left one night to urinate herself because she wasn't taken to the toilet. Patients being ignored constantly, the toilets dirty all the time and one time in the day room I saw dried blood on the floor that was there for days. And then there was a outbreak of norovirus and no visitors were allowed in for a week, but when the ward was open again they said it was all gone, but I myself witnessed patients being sick, and then they closed it again and reopened it, and on the day my mother left they closed it again, and my mother ending up giving it to the rehab place were she went. Surely she shouldn't have been sent to a rehab unit if she had norovirus, then I myself caught it, and now today I've just been diagnosed with E. coli. The place is disgusting and in a year they have had norovirus four times in one year in that hospital. I know that the only place I could have caught these illnesses is in that hospital because I haven't been anywhere else, or used any public toilets anywhere else, only there.",1
84493, My son as been left in dirty dressings on his skin graft . His meds were late + totally mist at times his cafeter was full to the brim I had to get a nurse to look at it he as seen his graft and thinks there's a problem but thay keep saying it ok A man acros from him as got an infection today becos his dressings were left off all day I'm totally shocked as I was lied to by a staff nurs on Monday evening my sons girl frend was stud nex to her when she was lieing to me saying my sons alarm had not been going off for over an hour I can not believe whots going on.,1
84887," I would like to leave this comment so that people can maybe know what to expect if they ever have the misfortune to be terminally ill at the cancer ward at Sunderland royal hospital . I was recently a patient there ,i was opposite a man who was obviously dying of cancer . This man was in a very bad way and looked to me like he didn't have long to live . He was left unattended in his bed practically every minute , There was no comforting angel (nurse) tending him , no caring doctors at his side, in fact he was just left on his own for at least the last 48 hours of his life . When he did finally start to show signs of dying in front of me ,which was very distressing to watch , the nurses finally came and tried to resuscitate him ,as if it was a routine they had to go through . I do not know if this man had any family or friends but no one was with him when he died only nurses doing their job in a matter of fact way ,to be frank like they couldn't care less . This whole episode terrified me and i thought what a sad way to end your life . This also made me determined not to end my time at Sunderland royal hospital hematology /cancer wards .",1
85086,"My elderly father was admitted with a urinary infection. He ended up with losing the sight in one eye due to infection, being left for two weeks - being pumped full of tramadol for pain - before a surgeon discovered he had an abscess in his shoulder and had to do an emergency op, being left in bed with a full catheter (was bed-ridden) not being empty and then being treated like an idiot when the bed got wet (he was so drugged up on tramadol he didn't know what day of the week it was! ). Care was appalling. It was not until we insisted the tramadol is stopped that the abscess was discovered. At one stage my father went blind - large sign put above his head saying Blind - and cups of tea/water/food were put on his tray but he was never told they were there and, on occasion, knocked them over. We witnessed dreadful way some staff talked to patients and it broke our hearts to know that our father was being treated the same way - like an inconvenience. On one occasion I went to nurse station about the way a male nurse had dealt with a patient with dementia. The response was - he's an agency - he's useless! Well - why was he there then? Thankfully my father was eventually transferred to Queen Mary's Roehampton - where the care was excellent.",1
85317,"My whole experience was disgraceful. I believe I survived in spite of, not because of Stoke Mandeville; from the triage procedure with a nurse chewing gum the whole way through, to an A & E doctor telling me I was having a panic attack and then discovering multiple pulmonary emboli. After 10 hours in the hospital, I was still suffering chest pain and shortness of breath. I was told by a seemingly very arrogant consultant, I was fit to go home. I said I still felt very ill. He told me I was being extremely selfish by blocking a bed for someone who was ill in A & E. It was a nightmare. It was not helped by some of nurses (who did not seem to speak good English) happily telling my family on the phone I did not have a blood clot.",1
85591, i was extremly shocked with chh when my fiancee was admitted for glandular fever that our gp had failed 5 times to see my partner was tranfered from hull ryal to castle hill and put on ward 20 or 21 the care he recieved was so appaling the nurse only got him his meds as my sister is law is a matron at a nursing home so she knew all the paperwork etc he had been left with no meds for over 24hours ....also for a man who couldnt eat offering him pies when he cant swallow luckily one of the good nurses give him a cuppa soup out of her own packup but the other nurse wasnt happy whe3n my sister in law put her in her place she didnt like it then she decided to snarl and my partner and said Ive gone out my way for you she had only changede his painkiller from tablet to dispersible also the cleanliness was not up 2 standard i really did feel for the old man next to my partner he had early staes of dementia he waited for 1 hour ringin his buzzer to go to the toilet however when they finally come he had weed in his pillow as he pysically couldnt get to the toilet and then to tell him he was bang outta order and he should ring his buzzer and also the fact they left his drinks miles away from him howevr there was a heroin addict on the other side of the ward and the nursesw would come runnning every time he soiled himself on purpose but then to treat a dementia suffer like that i must say i wouldnt recomend this hospital for anything than outpatients as the cardiology outpatients are great but i was truly shocked to see nurses acting so nasty when there job is to care if you dont want to care dont work in the nhs i was truly appaled,1
85717," On Wednesday 7th February I accompanied my son in law to A and E. he was suffering a significantly high level of pain from, he believed, his kidney. He was whisked into triage and then into a bed within minutes and 3nurses busied themselves giving him IV pain relief. Once his pain was under control a doctor came to see him and listened intently while he slowly, due to the meds, explained his history. At no time did the doctor appear impatient, hurried or unconcerned, neither did the A and E consultant he saw later. For personal reasons my son in law did not wsh to go to a specific ward, the doctors listened and reacted accordingly. They arranged tests, moved him to a quiet side room and he later saw Surgical doctors and an orthopaedic consultant. Unfortunately, the results weren't good, but at all stages, he was treated with compassion and dignity and I cannot stress strongly enough how impressed I was with the care he received. thanks to all",0
85685," Having been through a lengthy complaint with WGH I vowed to never return. Unfortunately my son would not have made the trip else where. Children's a and e were excellent. Once admitted my son received various drugs though was not wearing a identification band throughout. After the last complaint we had been assured the policy would be followed and extra checks made. My son was having regular nebulisers and continual oxygen as his SATS were falling dangerously low, in the night when my sons SATS were dropping nod I was trying to give my son oxygen which unsurprisingly he was becoming agitated with nurse turned off the SATS machine and did not return for ten minutes, she looked surprised I had turned the machine back on! One nurse was patronising, unhelpful and a liar.",1
85723,"My daughter attended this clinic for 12 months. The nurses and treatment was superb. They have specialist Mc Millan Nurses who care very much and make the whole trauma bearable. Her cancer was advanced and she did not survive after being transferred to Royal Marsden, but during that time at East Surrey she was close to home. When news of her death reached the chemotherapy staff they and her consultant were devastated and tears were shed. The measure of caring in my opinion and appreciated by all the family. The first time you are diagnosed you are scared and they do everything to allay any fears.",0
85928," my daughter was admitted to good hope via casualty she had pneumonia and a punctured lung. she was on intravenous antibiotics which started on friday night. she struggled and on saturday lunchtime it was thought she may have to go to theatre so she could have a tube inserted to help her breathe. ent consultant, registrar, intensive care staff were all in agreement they were all arranging theatres etc. a consultant who we have never seen before appeared told us our daughter wasn't going to theatre with all her disabilities and would just have pallitive care the antibiotics weren't working (she had only had 2 doses by then) i asked if there was another antiobiotic no there was not they only used this particular one? my husband asked if he meant she was to die in the near future yes within 12 - 24 hours. she survived the next 24 hours and we asked for her to be tube fed as we didnt want her to starve to death. she has now been discharged and is still poorly but the emotional trauma it caused for our family was horrific. no one seemed to know who this consultant was or why he could override everyone elses decision",1
86172," I was referred to the ""My Action Heart Programme"" (Westminster) by my consultant at Charing Cross. The programme has made a considerable improvement to my over- all health and well- being. The My Action Team is impressive, enabling me and all the participants to fully engage. The programme is holistic, so well thought through, and the combination of diet, exercise, motivation and psychology, in my view, constitutes preventative medicine at its best. I am really grateful to have benefited from it already and I am confident that I will continue to do so. JM",0
86259," I would like to pass on my thanks to all the staff in all the departments that gave me their care and attention during my recent visit to your hospital. Their quality of care & expertise enabled me to feel relaxed, comfortable and assured that I was in good hands. Thanks also to the kitchen staff for providing food of the highest order. I would also mention that these thanks & praise are given to all the staff with regard their dealing with patients requirements and comforts during a refurbishment programme being carried out in the CCU at the time of my visit. Kind Regards Alan Gee.",0
86406,"Good care and very efficient, that's what has happened. Been referred via my GP to King's Mill for treatment for sleep disorder. Staff have been fantastic. Pleasantly surprised at how efficient my appointments and care has been. I receive text alerts for appointments and if unable to attend I can reply to advise, resulting in a text with new appointment time and date. Although future appointments are a couple of months ahead, I'm impressed the department has embraced technology to communicate with service users. Time to shout out for the service I receive from my local hospital despite the strenuous times Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust currently face! Celebrate your staff, dispense with politics and get on with the job in hand - continuing the fantastic care provided by your nurses! Lead by example!",0
86686," Having undergone a quintuple bypass operation at St George's hospital in October 2012 I was invited to join the Cardio Rehabilitation course at St Peter's in November 2012. I was unsure at first at dedicating the time to attend twice a week for 12 sessions but soon realised the benefits the course provided. The staff were professional, friendly and supportive and gave me the confidence to start building my fitness and strength back up after a major operation and a period of recovery at home. The staff guide you through a set of warm up exercises, circuit training, stretches and relaxation techniques with a group of other patients who have had similar cardio treatments. The level of exercise is increased over the 12 sessions to match your fitness level and the staff take special care to monitor your blood pressure and heart rates at all stages. I would recommend the rehabilitation course to anyone following cardio surgery. It gave me the confidence to get back into the world and not hide away at home and was a great opportunity to chat to other patients about their feelings and worries following surgery. The course also offers educational sessions with useful information about diet, medication, coping with stress and other factors relating to heart disease and how to manage the condition moving forward. Overall, highly recommended and a big thank you to the girls at St Peter's for putting me back on the road to recovery!",0
86922," On Friday evening at around 9PM I attended the walk in center with chest problems. The walk in center (who were very good) referred me onto the Urgent Care center who did an ECG, all very quick with no waiting around. I found this service excellent as well. The only slight downfall is that I am still waiting for treatment and there seems to be a slight breakdown somewhere, but overall I am very happy with the service I received. I am also going to post feedback on my GP practice page about this due to the breakdown in communication between the two services (Ravenshead surgery)",0
87086," I had to attened A&E on Thursday 14th Feb.I arrived at 8am with uncontrolale shaking (due water infection) i sat down and waited for 30 mins before i was seen by a nurse, by this time i had become incoherent and was running a very high tempt. I was left in a side ward while the nurse dissapeared. My wife noticed my deterioration and that i did not know who she was and i still violently shaking. My wife manged to find a doctor and anthoner nurse, who came in and asked if my blood pressure and temp had been done, my wife replied no. They carried out tests that should had been carried out on addmission and immediately moved into Resuscitation telling my wife i was very ill.Then i had to be transported to Eastbourne Hospital. While my wife and myself are greatfull to Resuscitation team. There is a problem as when you are initially seen and by whom.

86968,"My mother was unwell with COPD and recently had to stay in East Surrey Hospital. She hadn't had a stay in hospital since her last child over 30 years ago. The care in A and E was ok, though it took hours to actually be seen by a doctor. She was the taken to a ward at night and then moved again to another ward - all very distressing. She was then rudely awoken in the early hours by a nurse in the dark trying to take a swab from my mother's mouth, without actually telling her what she was doing and why, and whilst my mother was asleep, which frightened my mother out of her wits! She then wasn't seen properly until later that day because they couldn't find her notes! On the day of discharge, which was all very sudden, she was put in an outpatient's room attached to the ward and we had to wait nearly 3 hours for medication, while my poor mum was uncomfortable, and when I asked on a number of occasions how much longer we needed to wait, the ward clerk was unhelpful and I think rude. My mother has always been frightened of going in to hospital and I can see why! Patients should be treated with respect and dignity, and I think they thought my mother was a nuisance because she spoke up and knows her own mind.",0
87199," I would like to thank the staff of the audiology Department for the truly excellent service provided for my mother when she attended recently to have new hearing aids fitted. The staff were fantastic being both uderstanding and patient with someone who was 96 and in addition, the administrative service was most efficient. At a time when the NHS receives so much criticism it is a great opportunity to balance the service with some really positive comments. Thank you for all your help - it was fautless. A great example of teamwork and organisation at its best! Yours sincerely Professor Bob Ireland",0
87352," I was admitted via A&E where I had been for 10hrs. In excruciating pain and serious blood loss and only given CoCodamol. Begged for morphine for 2 & a half hours only to be told each time Dr has been paged. I was screaming in pain. Dr never came until 12.30 am, I was admitted to Elsdon at 19.15!!! Dr was shocked I had been.left in such pain. Called for surgeon I collapsed due to blood loss had 3 units of blood tranfused and an emergency operation even though I had eaten just 3 hrs before. Life or death situation. Cant fault the care I received when I finally got it. I feel sorry for the nurses who can only do their best. I blame the Managers who run that hospital seriously and dangerously understaffed. Also many nurses were not British and they were very difficult to understand and they too found it hard to understand what they were asked. Everything was beyond my control. I hope I am never admitted to Basildon Hospital again.",1
87364," I have have had numerous consultations, eye measurements, an injection and two operations at St Paul's (ops in October and February) and the quality of care and the skill/dedication/knowledge of the staff has been excellent. The only real waiting time was for pre-op blood tests in January and this as the first Monday after the Christmas holidays so the wait was understandable. The Consultant, doctors, nurses, orthoptists, reception staff, etc have been great - very thorough.... Thanks very much - I would certainly recomment St Paul's.....",0
87596," Despite having been assured by the Audiology Department Receptionist that these details are shown under ""Our Services"" on the hospital website, my efforts to find this information have failed. The hospital has an alphabetic index of its Service and Departments, but the only listing under 'A' is Accident & Emergency. Similarly, there is no mention under 'O' of 'Our Services'. No doubt my great age and galloping senility is to blame for this incompetence, but I shall be most grateful to you for instruction on the means by which this information may be accessed. Interestingly, 'Audiology' is not listed in 'Which Dept did you visit' in your next box, #4.",0
87710," Why oh why oh why doesn't this website include a plan of the site and of each floor of the buildings so we can get some idea of where we need to go before we get there? Or, if there is a plan of the site somewhere, why can't I find it? I'm not stupid, you know - really I'm not. And where is ""audiology"" on the list of departments I might have visited - I did have to go there this morning, as well as to ENT.",0
87824," During January and February 2013 I attended this programme and found all the staff involved very caring and helpful. At all times they explained each element of the activities and went to great pains to help with progress. Full information about the desirability of exercise and diet and how to achieve full benefit was supplied and friendliness, politeness and expertise were features of the programme.. I was most impressed with the way we were treated and would not hesitate to recommend that all cardiac patients should attend. My thanks go to every member of the Ashford Hospital team.",0
87941, I posted a refview of this hospital and sent an e-mail to the patient experience e-mail address listed for the hospital. this has been sent back as undeliverable. I can't say I am surprised after the lack of communication this Trust has demonstrated towards me as a patient. There is no use listing an e-mail which soed not exist in the same way as asking a patient to call a number for advice when the person who answers the phone cannot give advice. BSUH please take note. Patients will be asking to be referred elsewhere through choose and Book. You are not the only provider of services.,0
88056,"My dad has cancer and fell and broke his leg. He was taken to QMC A&E. He was then transferred to ward C6. This ward was really dirty and I felt the care was lacking. My dad is now very ill in the City Hospital. He has a chest infection and a bed sore also uti. He did not have any of these problems until he went to C6. Dad's bed sore was a grade 3 they said, then said it had cleared up. He was confused and strange but nursing staff just said he was tired. Also I feel he got the chest infection because he was sent home on a cold day and not well. I wish he had never gone to ward C6.",1
88158," My Mother was admitted to Torbay A&E after suffering a nasty fall in Sainsbury's car park. Everyone involved in the care she received, from the time the ambulance arrived until she left the hospital the next day, were incredible. The Ambulance crew, Doctors, Nurses, Porters and even the lady who brought me coffee and biscuits were all caring, reassuring, friendly and professional. I really appreciated that I was allowed to be with my Mother practically the whole time she was in A&E and the fact that I was kept informed about her injuries and treatment, where she was being taken and how long she would be gone for. The treatment my Mother received could not be faulted.",0
88472," After breaking my wrists I was referred to Occupational Therapy. They hold a hand clinic 3 times a week where participants get a taylor made set of exercises which are frequently reviewed and updated. Depending on need then attendance can be for 1, 2 or all 3 sessions. The staff there are very supportive and positive. They are open with explanations and are a real tonic when you are feeling down or frustrated with your progress. They have a rather forbidding looking machine called the BTE (I never have worked out what it stands for - although I had a couple of ideas of my own!). Using this ""exercise"" machine alongside other exercises really promotes progress and recovery. It looks like a torture machine but really is not - it gently exercises and strengthens and with the pleasant company supervising it becomes quite a relaxing experience. As your recovery progresses there is usually the opportunity to start the ""Heavy Workshop"" where hand tools are used to do woodwork. Starting with a natty birdbox, if longer attendance is required then a garden planter or decorative shelves can be made.

During the time he spent on the ward he was treated with dignity and respect and the care given was of the highest standard. I was present during visiting time when his condition deteriorated and he suffered a heart attack. The staff team were very supportive and compassionate throughout informing the family of the clinical interventions that had been given and assisting the family present to be with him whilst he passed away. He was also moved to a room in order for the rest of the family attending the ward to say goodbye to him, The family cannot thank the staff team enough and they have certainly renewed our trust and faith in the NHS.",0
88827," First time I have used the walk in X Ray clinic and the team were great and it was a really great customer experience. Really friendly and helpful and there was no waiting time which was fantastic. Slight concern and why i have marked down cleanliness, I am a keen user of antibacterial handgels and from walking through the main original reception to the X Ray clinic about 15.30 ,3 of the pumps were empty or didn't work, the 4th was a success in the X ray clinic but I would have thought because infection is such a concern the pumps should always be full and working but i'm sure this was a one off. FYI the department isn't listed on the drop down below so had to put don't know. Many Thanks",0

89317," I had a colonoscopy on Saturday 9th March at the Alexandra day unit. From the start of the of the process following my referral all the staff I met or had contact with were helpful, friendly and professional. This ranges from the receptionist who called me to check the date of the appointment and rearrange to a more suitable date, to the consultant who carried out the procedure. I was impressed with the facilities, I did not have to wait long and the procedure was carried out with minimal fuss. My thanks to all those involved.",0
89447," This programme is operated by some lovely ladies in the gym. They are welcoming, enthusiastic, encouraging on an individual basis. They provide answers to questions which they encourage one to ask at any time during the process. The programme was both beneficial and gave me a good insight into my continuing recovery process. It is a shame that the gym facilities are so cluttered and cramped; and do not have any sensibly sized changing rooms or storage facilities. The designated changing rooms are the nearest toilets. The 'gents' (I assume the 'Ladies' is the same) was cramped, poorly lit and not equipped. It also had a wet floor on each visit I made, which is hardly conducive to changing. Two (or more) people trying to change would have been impossible. Like some others I travelled (on public transport) in my very light sports kit which was draughty in negative temperatures, snow and the rain of January, February and March.",0

Administration has been by a Cardiac Nurse, with the 'activities' directed by three members of staff. My sincere thanks to them! It is a real confidence builder, especially after major heart surgery at Papworth in my case, to know what I should be doing, to what extent, and why! And it has all been delivered with such superb communication (one to one for newcomers to the programme), enthusiasm and good humour. They are all to be congratulated, and thanked. John Leigh",0
89876," I go to the walk in centre often and it is fantastic, I can walk in and always see a doctor. This suits me as I live in Tadley and work in Milton Keynes and GP's in my home area are closed when I get home. I need a repeat prescription and often use the walk in centre at Basingstoke hospital as they are open till 8pm weekdays and also open weekends till 8pm. The NHS is closing down the walk in centre because of lack of registered users. During the last two months they have been changing the car park and spending a lot of money on it. I am not happy about this closure as I have no where else to go. The KPI's the NHS are using to close the Walk In Centre are not an appropriate measurement of success of a walk in centre. They should be using the flow rate of patients walking through the door and not go by the number of registered users (as with a GP surgery) The Walk In centre is always busy and it seems wrong to close it.",0

To do so, I must respond within 2 weeks of the date of the letter (it has taken nearly a week to arrive as its 2nd class post) or I will be deemed to have been discharged from the service!! I have tried calling the number advised about 20-30 times a day for the last week, each time it is either engaged, or when it does ring, it is picked up by an answering machine, on which I have also left my details. I have still not had a call back. Seems to me there is a game being played here - either that or their phone service requires to be fixed.",0

Myself and my son took my mother to the clinic on monday where after x rays and examinations she was told that she was going to be put on the emergency list for surgery because the so called infected cyst was in fact a strangulated hernia and blocked bowel.

After a wonderful team of paramedics and police officers revived him, having suffered eight cardiac arrests a total of 43 minutes without breathing, we eventually made it into the wonderful ITU unit at Hillingdon Hospital. The staff are angels. Doctors and nurses throughout the ward did everything they could for my husband and it took 28 days of their wonderful endless and heavenly care before he was eventually transferred back home to Edinburgh. Not only did they look after my husband but they looked after me as I was staying in London with my husband for the duration of his hospital stay. A wonderful attitude and approach to healthcare and a miraculous recovery by my husband. Thank you everyone at Hillingdon ITU xxxxx. He is now back at work looking totally healthy.",0

He was an incredibly fit man, 6' 4"" and still weighed the same as when he was 19. Went into Basildon, taken into ICU. After the op when I visited him, I was horrified to see his feet and legs nearly black. After a lot of complaining, they did put on surgical stockings. Sadly by that time the blot clot that killed him had already formed. I still carry a card saying that if I am ill or am in an accident do not take me to Basildon Hospital.",1
90804," My Father was admitted the this hospital on new years eve 2012. It was 4 days later when I was able to visit him. On my arrival to the ward, I found him crying bitterly and in sone considerable pain. The staff had pulled his curtain around his bed and just left him crying. The pain had started at 4.30 and it was 7.35 when i arrived on the ward. When I asked him why his was crying, he told me the staff would not give him his pain killers which his GP had prescribed him because it was against PCT policy to administer those drugs. I went home and brought in his drugs for him and they were then given to him. The following night I arrived to find his hands and wrists virtually bleeding as he had rubbed them all day due to an itch and not once did any member of staff ask him about his condition or treat it until I kicked off. E45 cream was them given to him. Staff on this ward have a duty to nurse and look after patients and clearly was not done in my Fathers case. I made an official complaint on the Monday 8th January and I am still waiting for the date of the meeting with complaints dept. Is this because of a huge backlog of them I wonder?",1

He was admitted to Stafford Hospital at the beginning of February with a suspected urine infection, he was taken by ambulance and as soon as we arrived in A&E the care he received was second to none. He was admitted that evening in the acute medical ward and all of the staff on that ward were fantastic he was continually monitored and checked every hour the medical staff kept us up to date on his condition all the time he was there nothing was too much trouble and the entire staff were very caring and professional. Tragically after a stay of 10 days and when he was on the mend his suffered a massive stroke which he could not recover from. When the hospital telephoned me in the morning the call was calm and sympathetic and when we arrived at the ward the doctors were there to meet us and fully explain what had happened they were so kind to my family particularly my mother who was as you can imagine, distraught. Dad was then moved to the stroke ward were once again the staff were fantastic they were so kind and sympathetic and explained everything to us and let us stay with dad all day. sister. Gail Stubbs was an angel and she was so caring genuine and professional and summed up what the NHS is all about.

I would strongly recommend EPU to others. Thanks a lot.",0
91526," On referral by our GP my 90 year old mother was admitted to A&E after suffering a fall. The ambulance team & the medical staff handled my mother in a most caring way and communicated in a timely manner - despite distractions caused by yobs in A&E !! The medical team diagnosed a dislocated shoulder as a result of the fall caused by a stroke but with the unfortunate complication of pneumonia. My mother after all the tests in A&E was admitted to Ward F1 within 4 hours and she received such reassuring care and sympathy. The doctors and nurses all communicated in a timely manner explaining her condition and what treatment she was receiving. Mum was kept most comfortable and our family were very impressed with their professionalism. Despite 2 weeks of care and treatment the pneumonia won and our lovely mother, having reached the age of 91 in hospital, passed away. The nursing staff were so caring and understanding when we said our last goodbyes to mum after she had died . Thank you to all the staff",0
91674," Fantastic place! Our daughter has just been discharged from Amazon ward after a 3 night stay. (Yes that's right on Easter Sunday!) Friendly, supportive staff who all do their best to make you feel at ease and informed about your child's stay in hospital. Quick efficient admittance on to ward. (side room was all ready and waiting for our arrival) Seen by nurse on arrival and by consultant pediatrician within 15mins of arrival. Quick response to queries/questions, call bell (within 5 min) and emergency response immediate. Excellent Nursing! All staff take time and effort to talk to both us as parents and our daughter who has just started saying 'Hiya' and 'Ta' Play Team Excellent play team. Very friendly and approachable. Encourage children to make use of the great facilities including the sensory room and outside play area and provide suitable toys and books to our daughter's room. TV also available at bedside. Catering Excellent catering facilities. Children's menu available in room on arrival. Snack/Food and drink arranged as soon as our daughter was well enough to eat. Good section available. Good choice of food appropriate to our daughters needs. Appropriate meal times for our daughter. Food arrived hot by friendly staff.

Drink of juice, water, milkshake, milk and sma available. Parent Facilities We felt very well catered for on the Children's ward. Our daughter was initially in HDU and we were offered parent accommodation whist she was in there. These are private rooms that are very close to the HDU room (We could hear when our daughter was awake) and have 2 single beds and a bathroom. Al linen, towels and pillows were in the room ready to get some much needed rest when we needed to. When our daughter was moved on to the main ward we had a comfortable pull down bed for one parent to stay with our daughter. All bed linen was provided including a pillow and towel. Which was clean and pressed. There is a a parents kitchen with Tea and coffee as well 'emergency rations' for parents to use. The kitchen is well equipped with hot water boiler, microwave, fridge and cutlery and crockery. There is also a Parent/relative sitting room with comfy sofas, tv, books and a computer next door to the kitchen. Cleanliness All areas of the ward were clean and tidy. Housekeeping/cleaning staff have a high visibility on the ward. Room cleaned everyday thoroughly and bins emptied regularly. All staff ensure good house keeping through out with clinical staff clearing up as the go along, play team ensuring toys and playrooms are clean and tidy and catering staff clear plates away promptly. Definitely would recommend the children's ward to family and friends.",0
91545,"After calling 999 on Good Friday for an ambulance when my husband feared he was having an heart attack, a lady operative stayed on the line talking to me and giving advice until the ambulance crew arrived. I would like to state that the two men who arrived restored my faith in human nature. They were efficient, quick and sympathetic but what struck me was how kind they were knowing that we were upset about what was happening. They took us to Bristol heart hospital and before they left they found me in the relatives waiting room and explained what was happening to my husband as I had not seen any doctors. From the time I phoned and spoke to the operator to the time the two ambulance men left me at Bristol I was treated with kindness and felt sure that my husband had been in the best of hands. He left hospital on Sunday after having an angioplasty thanks to their efficiency. Many thanks.",0
91548,"A member of my family wrote 2 weeks ago that my grandma had been sent home at 80 years old without any care in place. She was taken straight into respite where she was well looked after and sent home. The early hours of this morning she was rushed into the Friarage with pneumonia, seriously ill. Darlington memorial had taken xrays of my grandma's lungs almost 3 weeks ago and on the diagram placed an 'x' on the bottom lobe of one of her lungs. This is the same part of the same lung they have found the crackles of pneumonia last night. I fully believe this was detected and ignored by Darlington and she was sent home regardless of any diagnosis. My grandma was made to feel very much an inconvenience whilst in Darlington Memorial - my mum witnessed the doctors involved in treating her whispering and talking about her at the end of the bed without once consulting either her or my mum who was visiting about her condition. This included the 'suspected renal failure' that was mentioned throughout my grandma's notes but denied by the nurses on the ward. Infact, whilst visiting in Darlington my mum had to help another elderly lady with her legs bandaged up back to her bed after she rung her buzzer to be taken to the toilet and ignored. She felt the elderly patients she saw on the ward were treated as an utter inconvenience and with complete disdain. Rest assured that social services are now heavily involved and this WILL be taken further if we find that my grandma's suffering could have been prevented if treated 3 weeks and 3 hospital admissions ago. I am utterly disgusted as a care co-ordinator that someone could have been left to suffer as the result of someone else's poor decisions.",1

Once X-rays had been taken and a double Fractured jaw has been diagnosed he was told that due to Lack of resources he would have to makes his own way to the James Cook Hospital. He was then let go High on meds as a kite no one from the staff Assisted him to the awaiting car we organised nor Was his fractured jaw supported in any way. Thoroughly disgusted parent also staff at James Cook were Amazed at the way he had been treated.",1
91960," My husband , a frail elderly disabled man was admitted to ward I5 last year. He was initially admitted to the orthopedics ward after a fall. He was diagnosed with lung cancer while he was there. Instead of moving him to a specialist chest or cancer ward he was left on ward I5 forgotten and starved for 5 days . We begged staff and doctors to help has his condition deteriated rapidly. Nothing was done. When the chest specialist eventally came to see him ,she told us she had no idea he was still in the hospital. She agreed with us that it was ""inappropriate"" he had been denied food and drink.He was left begging for water while staff looked on or actively told us off for trying to give him a drink. By this time it was too late to save him, and although we asked that he brought home to die nothing was done for a further 2 days. Eventually after pleading with a district nurse from outside the hospital to help, the only one to listen to me and for which I will always be grateful, She did all she could to help get him home hours be fore he died. This was a horrible experience for me and my family and although we complained to the hospital, we have yet to recieve any satisfactory answers.",1
92106,"As a patient, absolutly appauled. I felt i was treated by reception as a third class citizen. On three occasions my appointments were mis-managed. On the third occasion I was on the bus and I expected there to be another problem so here is the story: 1. My first appointment in September 2012 i arrived at my Physio at 11. 10 for an 11. 20 appointment. I was kept waiting for 10 mins plus 5 minutes. The Physio said the appoinment has been cancelled... not true. 2. My second appointment in September 2012 arrived at 11. 50 for an appointment at 12. 00. .. Informed then that the physio is out sick. Nobody informed me by phone and another wasted day and bus fare. 3. My third appointment in September 2012 arrived at 11. 30 for an 11. 40 appointment. I was then told that the appointment was at 11. 20. This was incorrect, I then showed them the appointment card for 11.40. So really its a complete waste of my time. Funny how you have a sign about patients wasting your time in the waiting room. In my opinion you need efficient and polite reception staff and perhaps new management in this area.",0
92316," Bighton's County Hospital is situated in the most ridiculous position. It takes ages to get through the traffic in Brighton to reach the hospital. Once there, there is nowhere to park and the car park is always full. Why are the trust investing millions in expansion programmes for this site, when it would be better and probably more cost effective, to sell the site off for prime building development and housing, utilising the financial assets from the sale to build a new hosital which is situated somewhere you can get to such as Patcham on the A23? Furthermore, you have to be fit to visit this hospital because it's on top of a hill and the likelihood is, the only place you can get parked is at the bottom; And don't bother catching a train because the station is on the opposite side of the city and involves walking at least an hour to get there! The situation is ludicrous and defies belief.",0
92556," I was so upset with the care received by my mum at the royal Oldham hospital. When my kids or my mum becomes poorly my biggest concern is ""who is going to treat them?"" I have very little faith in the care provided at this hospital. I am a clinical NHS staff myself and could not for the life of me understand how these Nurses even qualified!! THeir lack of compassion for patients was outstanding! And from what i saw with my own eyes; the argument of overworked staff does not stand strong! My mum became very poorly last year and she was put on the MAU ward, the staff did not have a clue, they were like a bunch of headless chickens. My mum suffered a hypoglycaemic attack because they forgot to keep an eye on her blood sugars because she is diabetic. They then made subsequent errors which were picked up and stopped by me before they reached my mum. I kept feeling sorry for all patients that don't have medics in their family to watch wat the nurses and drs are doing. I was determined to complain to PALs but then my 3 year old son fell ill. I deliberately took him to Manchester royal infirmary, where he was seen then discharged but in the night he became worse so we had to call an ambulance. Unfortunately for us they took him to Oldham. My three year old very sick child was not even bothered to be seen other than to be triaged. After 2 hours of nothing I could see my son getting worse so I stormed out of Oldham and rushed him to manchester where they had to close off their children's a&e dept because he had reached a critical situation. It took them four/ five drs to bring him round after 6 hours of they're hard work to being him round. I was so busy with the aftermath of a poorly child and a poorly elderly mother that I never got round to complaining. This Monday mum became seriously ill again. Again we had o call an ambulance to take her in. This time I had to have a row with the paramedic because he wanted my 82 year old mother, with renal failure , diabetes , hypertension, gout n her legs and all sorts of other problems, to walk down the stairs! We called the ambulance because she collapsed. He insisted she was fine and that he could walk. We tried to cooperate wih him and asked to walk. She walked a few steps towards the door then collapsed again. At which point the clever cloggs paramedic said she could ""bum shuffle"" down the stairs she's fine! At this point I asked him for a stretcher which he refused we had a stand off and after arguing with him over my collapsed mum he eventually got one. Mum arrived in A&e and the drs took her straight to the resus/ shocking room because she was in a very bad way. I absolutely hate this hospital and a minority of their staff. It is such a shame coz majority of their staff are fantastic but the few minority are disgusting! G2 has got to be one of the worst wards iv ever seen. My mum was shaking like a leaf when a healthcare assistant yelled at her. This time I will be writing to PALS coz this isn't fair!",1

After suffering for at least 5 months, it wasn't until she visited home in Kent and I had to take her to A&E at QEQM that we now have the correct diagnosis - gallstones. The A&E staff were wonderful. I have the utmost respect for how they treated my daughter, kept us informed and then admitted her quickly after involving a surgical team that visited her in A&E. The nursing staff on Cheerful Sparrows were excellent but were obviously overstretched, and not helped by the rudeness and petty moaning of some patients. However, they contined to treat everyone with dignity and respect. I applaud the nurses.",1

Myself and my grandson asked for it to be changed and were told someone will do it asap but guess what it never was. We returned the next day to find no clean bed and my husband left sitting on a chair by the bed with his head on his knees unable to even stand up because of his illness so me and my grandson assisted him back into bed. I was so disgusted as I rang the ward before visiting him and was told oh yes he is fine had a wash and shave no problem well all I can say is my husband had been admitted many times in the RLUH on different wards and been very well cared for but ward 7a is one nightmare. My husband never came home.,1

93573,"At the beginning of april myself and my wife visited the A&E department. My wife,who has spina bifida and has to use a wheelchair, has been suffering from abdominal pains and they were becoming progressively worse. Having previously spoken to my sister whose daughter was having similar problems she advised me to go to A&E as they seen to my niece with no problem. We were greeted by a receptionist who began to take my wife's details. As soon as we got to why we had called in, the receptionist called over a nurse. The nurse, whose name and what specific job title she holds I do not know as she did not volunteer it, looked over the counter to see my wife who was sat in her wheelchair as I described my wife's current health problem. The nurse then told us that my wife would have to see her GP and that she wouldn't be treated at the A&E. I was almost speechless at this nurses condescending and uncaring attitude and it caused my wife some distress. My wife later, two days later, got an appointment with her GP. Three days after that my wife was rushed by ambulance to the same A&E department with severe abdominal pain and then admitted to hospital for the next four days. I would like to know why my wife was turned away at A&E on that Monday and an apology from said Nurse would not go amiss either. My wife's confidence in her health care has been severely dented by that department. I only hope you can help in reassuring her in some way.",1
93726," Grandad started complaining about abdominal pains cause he was previously diagnosed with Gallstones, the gall bladder was due to be removed on the 16th of April. Admitted my grandad to the A&E emergency department on the 26th of March. He was walking and talking but in his second day in hospital his health started deteriorating. The nurses were ignorant and unpleasant, not enough care was given to my grandad. 2 days later he was transferred to the ICU Unit but we were told he was placed in the ICU Unit because they have better care there hence making him a patient of the High Dependency Unit. The nurses would not tell us anything regarding him, but he was deteriorating rapidly, the communication was poor and the care given to him was very poor as well. On Sunday 31st March, 4 days after he was admitted into hospital, the doctors then decided to take X-rays and do a dialysis, hours later my grandad had passed away. We then found out that he was infact critical when bought to the ICU Unit and was in for Intensive Care and that he actually had pancreatitis because they had diagnosed him wrong. The doctors mislead us and did not give enough care to my grandad as he needed. Worst hospital ever and the worst health care given to any person!",1
94045," There is no co-ordination between the different services across the NHS - this particularly affects elderly people. Everyone neatly does 'their job' and the other parts of the operation are of no concern. However this lack of systemic thinking is a disaster but allows you to avoid blame and avoids you taking responsibility for any co-ordination - it passes the administration and the costs and the time loss on to individuals. So you save money at individuals expense to the detriment of the patients. Here is my example: my father is 94, he needs to visit a department in your hospital. I ring one number to book an appointment. I book it. I need to ring his surgery for transport. I then need to ring Patient transport to book transport. The appointment and transport don' t fit. I spent 3 hours over 4 days made over 10 phone calls and a letter to sort it. At each 'stop I need to ring 3 or 4 times. I now need to go and undo the whole appointment and start again. Thank you for nothing.",0
93968,"My sister in law was taken ill following a chemotherapy session, she was severely dehydrated. An ambulance was called by her gp, this took six hours to arrive. She was then taken to hospital arriving at 11pm, she was left on the bed, hooked up to machine and not seen by a doctor until 6am the following morning. She was not given an IV until 6:30am, by which time she was severely dehydrated despite us trying to get fluids into a her and hallucinating. She was taken to Harbledown Ward where she was well looked after during the day but experienced some rough treatment during the night which resulted in severe bruising to her arm where she was manhandled by a nurse. Informed by a doctor on the a morning that she was leaving (whilst on her own), that the chemo had caused irreparable damage to her kidneys and that there was no hope of any further treatment for her cancer. This has proved to be untrue as she has seen her oncologist today. The whole episode was shabby treatment of a genuinely ill person which has resulted in her now being too frightened to go back into hospital.",1
94152," My mother was admitted with Atrial Fibrillation by emergency ambulance in the early hours of a day in February and 14 hours later she was discharged? Way too soon, they didn't consider age or what might result from this heart problem. Re-admitted 5 days later with Pneumonia and 5 day later discharged? Way too soon as they didn't cure Pneumonia! Re-admitted 7 days later with? Pneumonia again! and discharged 5 days later? They didn't bother to review case and didn't cure Pneumonia! Re-admitted 24hrs later having caught a hospital bug. This made is presence known within 3hrs of coming home and by midnight it was very distressing indeed. Emergency doctor came at 3am and said it was ""food poisoning""? Complete and utter rubbish diagnosis! She was upon her own doctor's instruction re-admitted at 14:30hrs that day into a room with ants (hence the title) crawling all over floor! I noticed hospital regularly had a stale air odour, condensation running down windows and I never witnessed any one cleaning up very often. Nursing staff were however good. Doctor and nurse in casualty very good but consultants and ward doctors ignorant and failed to keep us informed or ""consult"" me on my mother condition. I will be writing a formal complaint in due course now that my mother has been successfully treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital after I advised doctor not to re-admit to Airedale. Would I recommend Airedale? Considering that my mother almost died over the Easter 2013 weekend, the following weekend, the suffering and debilitation my mother has gone through I would sooner drive a bulldozer through it than recommend it!",1

This doctor upset and frightened my mum he made her feel as though she was a nuisance,all i can ask now is had she gone in before that would she have been saved? I hope that doctor that treated my mum in this awful way will have this on his conscience forever,i will find out his name and i will write personally to him,he might not of been there at my mums death and maybe nothing could have been done but his disgusting attitude frightened and upset her to the point she would not go in,and for that i place my mums death firmly at his door......",1
128610,"On the 21st April my daughter went to the A&E department as she was suffering with vomiting, fever and shakes which she'd had for the previous couple of days and felt were getting worse, therefore became quite frightened. She was dismissed by a nurse with flu and told to take paracetamol, however the following day her condition was so bad that our local GP referred her to the Queens Hospital Burton where she was admitted until Friday afternoon, ie 4 nights. On the Monday her temperature was over 40. Thanks to the care she received at the Queens Hospital Burton she has now almost recovered, but her visit to the Samuel Johnson did not instil any of us with confidence. We have remained anonymous as we are not looking to blame any particular individual, but feel a lack of confidence in that nurses are left to diagnose potentially very poorly people without enough knowledge of what may actually be wrong with them.",1
95572," My elderly confused mother was admitted after a fall and rescue by the Police. Visiting her for two weeks I noticed her breathing became painful and her chest rattled. I reported this often to the staff who checked their notes to say there was no problem and I kept asking for this to be addressed. On the day I was told she was medically fit for discharge I was also told she had contracted hospital acquired pneumonia. I was told she was incontinent. She is frail and had mobility issues......she was left in her mess as the staff were too busy to care for her as other patients were no doubt in acute need. On her discharge the notes said she had no hearing issues. Her one hearing aid went missing on the ward and the other had a failed battery ....I noticed after a week. In an acute medical ward with infections the tea attendant did not wash after taking cups from patients and handing them out. Mum's glasses went missing as did her walking stick. Some staff were very kind. Others aggressive in their stress. She thought she was in the Workhouse, her childhood fear.",1

My two friends who were also in the car tragically died. The care and service of the Royal London hospital was amazing. After an immediate scan which showed that my neck or back was not broken,followed by an operation to repair the ruptures in my intestines and various other injuries and many many bruises established , they then took me to the trauma ward. The care, kindness and help of doctors ,physio therapist was terrific. The nurses were, without exception, absolute ANGELS. Considering the cases they have to deal with in that kind of ward , I am most impressed and very very grateful to all of them . I am now recuperating at home. I recommend the Hospital to anybody.",0

I was disappointed as we didn't know and only had enough for one photo where as if i'd have known i would have taken more money for more pics. Otherwise a lovely experience at this hospital, we weren't kept waiting long and the technician was lovely and reassuring. We are now looking forward to 20 week scan.",0

95766," My son rang for an ambulance at 10.55pm after breaking his arm. As we no longer have an a&e at Bishop Auckand it took 11/2 hrs to arrive and collect him. I met him at a&e at 12.50am he was asked a few brief questions and we were told to go to the waiting area. The smell of urine was stomach churning and there was vomit on the floor. He was not seen by a doctor till 4am, he was in terrible pain & I had to request painkillers. At no point were we advised of when he was going to be seen, communication obviously not a strong point! The doctor who examined him was very abrupt and kept repeatadly asking him to raise his arm & bend his arm back as he was sure my son had only ruptured his bicep, it was clearly impossible for him to raise his arm as he was in severe pain. My sons arm was finally x rayed and it showed he had broken his humorous. We had to witness the doctor and nurses openly discussing what to do with his arm and the doctor admitting that he did not know what to do. We finally left a&e at 5am with a box of tramadol and an appointment to return later to the fracture clinic. The vomit was still on the floor.",1

Unfortunately our bad luck didn't finish there,my step mother has unfortunately been diagnosed with dementia,and is currently on ward b47 at first we were pleased because it is an actual ward for dementia however my step mum managed to escape from the hospital with in less than 24 hours and was found wondering along Mansfield rd in Arnold by my uncle.So you can imagine our horror when she managed to escape again yesterday morning and was found in Toton.The ward is locked and you have to be buzzed in and out,it wasn't visiting time so it had to be a member of staff that let her out! .I call that severe neglect on the hospitals part,I wouldnt trust them to look after a goldfish!.",1

I told the nurses that mum needed extra furosemide to reduce the fluid. told the nurses and doctors that she should never have been taken off her blood pressure pills because she has heart failure.the nurse taking her blood pressure said mums pressure was up and down I said she should be on blood blood pressure pills, she said was supprised I said read her records.I contacted mums CHD nurse that visits at home, he contacted the heart failure nurse at KGH and she went down to mums ward (Gentina Ward) and got mum back on blood pressure tablets, oxygen and increase of furosemide I do not think my mum would be hear today as the patients in the ward said they thought mum was going. mums fluid decreased but they discharged her too early 15 days later she is still home but still very ill. when mum was discharged, I argued with the head nurse and stated that I wanted to see a doctor as mum was not well enough to be discharged, most of the ward was discharged late at night because there was only two nurses looking after 30 patients. make sure the hospital treats the whole body not just what you go in for.",1
95235,"My dad was sent to Russell's Hall emergency department at the beginning of March 2011, by his doctor after being unwell and having some abnormal blood test results. He was kept in this department for a couple of days while they kept taking more blood from him and running tests. They eventually sent him to a ward, where it was noticed by myself and my mother that he was acting strangely, I notified one of the nurses, they came and saw him, then told us it was our fault for overwhelming him with us being there - the family that he loved and was with him all the time. By this point we were still no nearer to finding out what was causing my dad to be ill. We asked to see the consultant that was treating my dad, we had a meeting with the consultant where we asked them questions about what they thought was wrong with my dad but didn't really get any straight answers. By this point in time, my dad was really beginning to deteriorate, his body swelled and he could no longer walk around, he was moved to another ward, this time a ward for stomach, liver and kidney problems, but we still had no answers for medical staff as to what was causing my dad to be so ill. He became bedridden and developed massive swelling all over his body, nothing was ever done to reduce this swelling, he didn't eat or drink, and we began to notice that his toes were going black. He was in so much pain, especially in his head, his tongue swollen so much that he could hardly talk and it was heartbreaking to see a man I loved so much in that much pain and he wasn't being treated for anything, they would give him morphine for the pain but that was it. He developed bruising all over his body, especially on his head and legs and yet they still didn't know what was wrong with him. He died on Easter Sunday 2011, he had had a bleed in his stomach, and all his organs were failing, he couldn't breathe his lungs had filled with fluid, and we watched him die. It was the most painful day of our lives. The doctor said he died from multi organ failure and acute vasculitis, but still to this day we don't know what caused him to have organ failure or why nothing was done to stop things from getting so serious. He was in that place for 5 weeks and was only 66. I cannot fault the nurses on that last ward he was in, they tried their best to look after him and keep him comfortable, but to me, he never got any proper treatment from the doctors. I really believe that his death could have been prevented, and we still don't know why our dad died 2 years on.",1

95927," I recently took my mother to the A&E departement at St Mary's Hospital as she was suffering from chest pains. She had recently suffered from a heart attack and I explained this to the receptionist . She was on the verge of fainting and could no keep her head up as tears were falling down her face because of the agony she was in. The receptionist at first did not notice me behind his desk as he was on his iphone. Once he noticed me and took all the details he told me to wait for the nurse to call us. As I sat back down I realised the severity of my mother's condition and could not sit there and see her in such pain. As I went back the man who I had originally spoken to was talking to someone else so I spoke to others behind the desk but they refused to serve me and told me to wait for the other receptionist. When he was done (again seeing him on his iphone) I asked him if he could get someone to look at my mother right away however he told me that I had to wait and that he had informed the nurse. I told him she was in a lot of pain and had to beg him to get him but he kept shouting at me and repeating ""I have told the nurse, you'll have to wait"". I was distraught knowing that my mother was in pain and was being refused care and to top it all off I was being shouted at by the receptionist who did not care. The nurse eventually called us in. This is absolutely disgraceful and I was treated with such lack on attention and respect. Considering that she had a serious history of heart problems she should have been classified as an emergency but was left to suffer until I had to beg for help. Furthermore, the nurse was not busy with another patient from the moment we walked in to A&E so there are no excuses for the unnecessary wait and the way we were treated. I am appalled and this was a very distressing experience as we were not treated like human beings.",1

People that have to attend emergencys and appointment should not pay for parking. The parking officers will soon know if that person is lieing to get out of parking fee by checking appointment list.

96624,"After a few days of acting out of character, my father in law took a turn for the worse on a Sunday and was taken by ambulance to another hospital in the area. He stayed there almost 3 weeks, until we were given the devastating diagnosis of Kidney cancer. He was moved to Gervis Pearson, as they were the specialists in the field. It was here that his care was dramatically improved. We were told it was sadly a terminal condition. The care he and us recieved will never ever be forgotten by our family. They cared not only about him as a patient but us as those who were losing someone they loved. In the end, the visiting hours were 24/7, and the nurses/doctors were like angels. He only lasted another 3 weeks, but the nurses became his friends, despite him suffering from hallucinations, aggression and dementia due to the cancer ravaging his body. The funeral is next week and we have asked for no flowers only donations to this wonderful ward. I dread to think how his last weeks would have been if he had stayed in the other hospital. So thank you to you all, you gave a chink of light to our darkest hour.",0

Once my facial swelling went down it was confirmed that I had a broken eyesocket, nose and cheekbone with permanent nerve damage. it really helped that i had to leave half naked in a gown in distress. not everyone that arrives in an ambulance late at night has been fighting. assault is different and your attitude was appalling. no faith whatsoever, you need a severe review",1
96856," My husband suffered with Parkinsons Disease, he was 84. He was very poorly and bleeding through his catheter. He was taken into rescusitation. The treatment he got their was fantastic but he was very ill and his blood pressure had dropped to I think 59. The staff managed to get his blood pressure higher and he started responding again but I and my family were told that he would not be rescusitated further. After a while he was transferred to an intensive care room for a couple of days and then he was moved into a Ladysmith ward I think it was number 43. He was their for about 10 days and the nurse said that he was well enough to come home. I requested to see the Doctor which I did, and he said the same but I refused to have him home as he was bleeding again plus he had the beginnings of pneumonia. He stayed on ward 43 for another day and then was transferred to the discharge ward 41. When I saw him their he was unresponsive and he staff were taking fluid out of his lungs. This is the man that the Doctor wanted to send home! The nurse said he should have been kept in the previous ward to be treated. Early the next morning my lovely Reg died. On his death certificate it said he died of - Bilateral Pneumonia - advanced Parkinsons Disease - Urosepsis with Hematura. This again is the man that the doctor wanted to send home. Disgusting and very upsetting, I know my husband was 84 and it probably was his time but I really do think that the older patients get put at the back of the queue for care.",1
96927," I am more than a little disappointed, that you haven't even bothered to reply to my previous posting. All the messages before and some after have had some level of response but mine has none. I tried to give reasonable and balanced feedback, in the hope that this would be used to look at ways of improving the patient experience and to help with the image of your hospital. But the lack of response leads me to wonder, if you only make this facility available to your customers, because you have been told that you have to, and you really have no interest in analysing or using this feedback......",0
96931," 16 May was the first time that I visited the Hospital and I was very impressed. In particular: 1. The consultant urologist that performed my procedure was excellent demonstrating a high level of skill and care despite relatively limited time in the role. The post-procedure effects were also minimal as a result. Please pass on my thanks. 2. The professionalism, care, cleanliness and general management of the hospital was first-rate. In light of recent complaints re the NHS, this hospital demonstrated the opposite. I hope that I will have subsequent procedure(s) with the same urologist at the same hospital - please confirm. Also I plan to send a written letter of support, if appropriate - please advise.",0
97323," family very upset.My brother who had been diagonised with squamus cell carcinoma,whilst waiting for chemotherapy,developed an infection in his lymph nod in the groin.He was admitted in the A&E of the Watford General hospital.He was shunted from ward to ward 4 times in three weeks.He was not properly looked after.Was left in his own faeces and urine on three occasions.His infection could have worsened in this condition and could have been the cause of his dereriation.Not only good nursing care was absent but there was absolutely no contact or communication with the family by the team doctor or doctors in the ward.By the third week my brother was so distressed that he begged to be moved out of this hospital.luckily a hospice care was arranged.He passed away in tyhe hospice after ten days,peacefully,well cared and looked after by the staff nurses and doctors",1
97299," My mother arrived at A&E by Ambulance.She was started straight away on treatment for Pneumonia.She was then laid on a trolley in great discomfort(,she has Spinal Stinosis)for 10 hours in the dept.I would like to say the Doctors/Nurses were very apologetic but the fact remains she had to lay there for 10 hours..Luckily her family were able to offer some comfort over this very long period. She was taken to an assessment ward, the doctor had told me she would be be admitted to the acute medical ward.After three days on oxygen the family were told she would be moved to the complex care ward as she needed more care. The next afternoon to my mums distress she was told she was going back to her care home.This without discussion with her family. My mother has not recovered wel,l and is not helped by the fact she feels she was sent back when she was very ill. I would never let my mother be taken to Halifax again.",1
97483," My mam was taken into A&E on Sunday 10th Mar after being discharged on the afternoon, she had been discharged with Ecoli in her urine, when we arrived at A&E she was only just awake her blood pressure, her blood sugar were very low, she was dehydrated, we arrived at 10pm and it was busy but not over run, but it took them till 4am to say they were keeping her in, still not telling us much, they took her to ward 1 she was for a week then transferred to ward 2, the staff were ok but did treat my mother as if she was a fussy old woman who complained, they tried to get her sats on every digit she had but it was hard work, they pricked every finger end numerous times a day for weeks do her blood sugar, till her finger ends were flattened and black, then after a doctor had seen her they decided to take it from her ear lobe which still was left bruised, she was often left with her medication on the table for her to take herself but she couldn't even sit up and wasn't eating or drinking only small sips, I asked a male nurse one day why her medication was in on her cupboard which she couldn't reach, he said that ""oh she has had her evening medication, ""two weeks after she went on to ward 2 they moved her into a side ward when I asked why they said because she had Ecoli and it was infectious, I asked why had she just been put there after she had been in a bay for 2 weeks, and had come in hospital with the Ecoli that she had been sent out with, I was told that there had been no side rooms empty, my mother was on ward 2 for 8 weeks, and she was getting weaker and frailer all the time, they were giving her drips that was just causing pooling in her elbows that I had to bring to there notice. I often had to tell them that the sheets were wet. Often I visited and saw that my mothers table and locker were just filled with cup after cup of tea that she hadn't drank because she couldn't without help and bottle after bottle of a liquid they were giving her but again she couldn't drink without help which no one seemed to do. When my mother had been in hospital about 6 weeks they started to say there was no point in keeping her in there and that she should really go back into the community, she had been living in a residential home but the staff who organise these things and social worker said that she would need a nursing home so I was told that that she would be going on the 28th Apr, on that day I received a call from a nurse who told me my mam was to ill to be moved, the on duty doctor wanted a load of tests doing, after watching being picked up so roughly by the radiographer, and listening to her screams while the doctor tried to take blood gases I told them to stop, the doctor I saw agreed, and they left her alone on the Monday they put her back in a side ward were she became much calmer and actually looked better but the consultant insisted that she still leave the hospital and go to nursing home she died 3 days later, I need answers, she deserved better",1
97455," My experience of the colonoscopy procedure itself and the staff involved was very positive -- they were helpful and considerate. Two minor adjustments to the experience could make things better: 1. The detailed 3-page form patients are asked to complete when signing in would be much easier to fill in if sent in advance. The detailed information on previous illnesses, medication and allergies would be much easier to access at home. It is not so easy to remember on the day. Sending the forms in advance would also speed up the booking-in process. 2. The addition of a coat hook on the back of the door of each of the patients' toilets would be most helpful. As it is there is nowhere to put coats/jackets which have been taken off.",0
97636, My mother passed away on Simpson Ward at Torbay Hospital after a brief illness. She had been admitted as an emergency on the Thursday following a fall due to increasing heart failure. Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff her condition continued to deteriorate and she sadly left us on the Wednesday just 6 days later. I cannot speak too highly of the care and attention my Mum received from the Doctors and Nurses - despite the ward being very busy they always had time for her and for us as a family. She was kept very comfortable and treated with great compassion and her passing was very peaceful and dignified.,0
97678," My husband was admitted very early on 25th April, bleeding from the mouth, which I thought was a violent nose bleed but in fact the cancer had moved to a main blood vessel. He was immediately treated once we reached Airedale, with blood transfusion, oxygen. I hadn't realised how serious it was at the time, but everything was carefully explained to me and that he was not expected to last the night. Members of family came and we were given a private room and everything was explained by doctors very compassionately. We were all looked after with whatever food and drinks we required. Everyone was so kind. Meanwhile, my husband was relieved of pain with drugs. Monitoring was constant. He died very peacefully in the early hours of 26th. My family cannot thank the hospital staff enough for all their care.",0
98037," I was admitted to A&E with breathing problems on the 14th Dec 2012, spent several hours in resuscitation and was taken care of very well. I was then transferred to ward 12B. After repeatedly trying to tell nurses and doctors on the ward I was feeling very unwell and my breathing was getting worse I collapsed with Respiratory Failure and was transferred to ICU where they fought to save my life and stabilize me. ICU unfortunately broke my nose and the skin when trying to put a face mask on and left my nose scared and extremely sore for several months. I also contracted a skin infection to my Right Leg after a doctor replaced an arterial lead.The area was not cleaned before he attempted to replace this lead. I spent 7 days in ICU then was transferred back to the ward. I was so weak but left to feed myself, wash my self and on one occasion had to ask a friend to help me change my pajamas and to help me wash as I had messed myself, despite me telling the nurses I needed the commode and then the fact that I had actually messed myself, no one was about to help me help, there just wasn't the staff to help. While on the ward I witnessed some elderly and disabled patients struggle with feeding and washing. On one occasion I witnessed an elderly gentleman (Alzheimer sufferer) become frustrated. During the night he wandered and was abusive to other patients and staff. He woke me from my sleep by smashing me over the head with his walking stick. If it wasn't for the fact that I was wearing a ventilator mask he could have done serious damage, the night staff thought this was funny! My stay at Peterborough City Hospital was a nightmare, if it wasn't for just a few of the kind and helpful nurses that were on the ward at various times of the day and the fact I was so ill I would have signed myself out of that hospital shortly after coming out of ICU. I was transferred to Papworth Hospital on the 9th of January for a short stay and further investigations. They are a far more caring hospital in every way, the staff are certainly more caring and around when you need them. Peterborough City Hospital is a disgrace to the National Health Service.",1
98364," On the 17th of may at 20 weeks gestation I came into Hillingdon hospital maternity unit experiencing extreme abdominal pain. The midwife at triage was so unhelpful, she checked the heart beat which was fine but I kept telling her I was in a lot of pain and bleeding, She said the doctor was coming but generally ignored by pleas for help. Finally a doctor came to examine me, felt my tummy and the baby responded to her touch, she then got bleeped on her pager and went away for another 30 mins. When she finally returned and checked me, my membranes were protruding and I was then rushed to the labor ward. I went on to have hand loose my baby on that day. Two weeks earlier at 18 weeks I had called to say i was experiencing an intense abdominal pain, only to be told by the midwife that it was nothing but stretching pains, I wish I hadn't let her fob me off as I never had any such pain with my son. The maternity service at hillingdon is terrible I really wish I had insisted on choosing a different hospital. The only good thing out of that horrid nightmare was a midwife who looked after me while I was loosing my baby. I still feel so much anger at the way I was treated through out this pregnancy.",1
98911," On Tuesday the 28-05-13 I took my father to the A&E dept of St Helier in Sutton. He had passed out, hit his head, was bleeding from the head wound, his speech was very slurred, his heart rate was around 30bpm and he was having trouble breathing. Upon booking him in to A&E and explaining exactly all I have mentioned above to the A&E reception staff we then sat and waited to be seen by a nurse for over an hour while people with limps and sprained ankles who were being booked in after my father were seen before him. When we were eventually seen the doctors realised my father had a heart condition and required an operation. I think it's fair to say that when someone limps into A&E it's fairly obvious what the persons issue is however my fathers condition was rather more worrying as we could have been dealing with a stroke and I feel that the length of time he was left unattended was disgraceful.",1
99937," My mother was taken into hospital in a state of dehydration. She was left to dehydrate further for a week without any obvious treatment. She was finally transferred to Scarborough where she was a put on a drip. When I saw her the day she was transferred she looked as though she was on the point of dying. After two days on a drip at Scarborough she was much, much better. The staff nurse there asked, couldn't they have done this in Whitby? Continued dehydration at Whitby caused her to become mentally confused by day and to have nightmares at night. This was an avoidable situation.",1
100194," Never having needed to use this department before, I have been very pleased with the efficient, and helpful way my consultations have been dealt with. All the staff were pro active and pleasant The Audiologist took time to explain all aspects of the hearing aids that I would be fitted with, what to expect, how to manage the equipment, sufficient time was allocated so that all these aspects were clear. The time between my first hearing test appointment, and the appointment to fit the aids was two days, and I came away with everything I would need, and a follow up scheduled for 4-6 weeks.. A most impressive service",0

Time spent at hospital was 1 hour and 50 minutes including a visit to x-ray unit. Contacted by phone a couple of days later by therapy centre, appointment arranged. Assessment made and course of therapy mapped out with next appointment arranged for late June. Time spent at therapy centre was 40 minutes.

100877," My sister was taken into Torbay Hosp A&E by ambulance and spent time in A&E, EAU3 and Warrington Ward. She was suffering with a non moving stupor as a result of very serious mental health issues and was subsequently transferred to a mental health hospital. The staff at Torbay hospital were wonderful. They offered kindness, compassion and humanity. Their patience and professionalism shone through. They helped my sister begin to move, they made sure she was not dehydrated, they helped her to start to eat., they made sure she was clean and comfortable. The dignity my sister was allowed was outstanding. Thank you.",0
101084," I have been treated very well in the Trauma Clinic at Queens and would like to send my thanks to the doctors and nurses that work in this Thursday clinic. However when I was there on 20.06.13 I witnessed a disturbing sight. A very elderly woman who was asleep was parked in consultation room 21 opposite where I was sitting. She had been left alone for at least the 30mins that I had been sitting outside. Eventually a senior nurse entered the room and called another nurse who had been sitting alone someway off the corridor to come in and sit with her patient, but as soon as the senior nurse disappeared the patient's escort nurse went back into the corridor and sat down although I had offered her a chair to take into the room, that was in the corridor. I think this is terrible. To leave a very elderly and vulnerable patient alone is disgraceful. I do not think this escort nurse was from Queens as she did not have a name badge but perhaps she can be tracked down and admonished",0
100958," 18th June 2013 - Bronchoscopy. To All on Gastroenterology Dept. Many thanks for providing a first rate service. Excellent from start to finish. From a warm welcome at the reception desk to discharge from the recovery room. Special mentions to one of the nurses for full explanation and re assuring at all times, and to the two Big Guns - (consult / registrar) who both could relate well at the full patient level and had provided an earlier full consultation. Smiles abounded and there was a definite sense of a team spirit engaged within the Department. Recovery - aided well with others on hand. Could we make your team spirit contagious? Well Done !

101264,"most terrifying experience imaginable. she went into Watford mat seven days overdue her expected date had been in and out of early labour since 18 days beofre baby was duel and had been sent home. each time she went to be checked waters were leaking but no one seemed concerned until reg saw her when she was having strong contractions and said she must not be sent home until baby was born. after further 28 hours in agony and no available bed in delivery being kept on antenatal ward baby only being intermittently monitored she was taken to delivery where it was soon evident there were problems, baby's heart tachycardic and then stopped. crash team attended labour and epidural continued with induction drip. baby's heart stopped second time then started but kept dropping, midwife was observed to be nodding off in the corner when she was supposed to be closely monitoring. no one seemed that overly concerned to take action until daughters partner insisted on c section after daughter told him she could not do it as she was exhausted. midwives conflicting with each other in delivery room as to which action to take. eventually consultant decided on c section when baby's heart was becoming very slow. all in all a very harrowing and unneccesary experience which has left my daughter very dissillusioned with the unit and midwifery care during labour. but the theatre team were wonderful having got my beautiful granddaughter out in 5 mins. just hope this doesn't happen to another mother but sadly I'm sure it will",1
101350," My father in his 70s suffering with cancer was admitted to LRI. Reason he was there was because he was told on a prior visit to the Oncology dept to stop taking the steroids he'd been on since the beginning of the year-not slowly over months but just stop cold turkey. This was extremely dangerous advice and as a result only a couple days after stopping them he had awful withdrawal symptoms and felt like he was having a heart attack. Was rushed to A&E where thankfully they did promptly put him back on the steroids. He spent a week and a half in hospital-they messed us about everyday saying he was coming out the next day then they changed their minds, didn't seem to know why he was in there or what to do with him-he should have been released as soon as he was back on steroids. They were concerned we didn't have the facilities to care for him at home so instead they decided it'd be better for him to stay in hospital until we did where they completely neglected him letting him develop an awful bedsore. Also pain meds weren't given frequently enough even though we made sure to tell them, he was in agony most of the time. LRI completely incapable of looking after their elderly patients, I wouldn't advise anyone to take their elderly relatives to the LRI. On a prior occasion when at home with his palliative nurse, she noticed he had brain tumour/stroke type symptoms (eyes not focusing together, numb down one side of face) and so she rang the LRI concerned his cancer had now spread to the brain. She was completely dismissed and told that his type of cancer doesn't spread to the brain (although rare it had done). Luckily he saw his optician a week later who immediately noticed his symptoms and sent him to the LRI for a scan. If it wasn't for this he may never have gotten treatment for his brain metastases. Unbelievable that the person on the phone could just dismiss the symptoms of a brain tumour or stroke like that, what they just couldn't be bothered to even see him to confirm or rule something that serious out? Everything about this hospital is just awful they seem to not have a clue what they are talking about and give extremely dangerous advice like to stop taking steroids cold turkey and dismissing the symptoms of a brain tumour over the phone! This is people's lives we are talking about! Absolutely shocking. My father died a week and a half after being in the LRI. Not only are his family grieving his death we have the added upset of knowing how terribly he was treated in hospital throughout his whole illness and especially in his last weeks.",1
101351," Excellent care from the moment we stepped into Reception. All staff understood our needs and we did not have to explain further (sorry to say this but here English is first Language and makes a real difference). A & E Dr was brilliant, not just with diagnosis, but with personal care and what to do next. This is a rare vist for us and I was totally impressed (how much I wonder would this cost in the USA?). Always known we don;t appreciate our NHS enougth. Thank You all and we will do everything we can to support you.",0
101603," Had consultation at Glenfield Hospital on 17 June 2013 with Prof Dias, followed by pre op at Glenfield on 21 June. Admitted as a day patient on 26 June for the operation. In addition to the speedy timescale from the initial consultation to the operarion I found all the staff, nurses, doctors, anaesthetist, physio etc very polite, caring, friendly and chatty. I was well informed about the procedure, operation and aftercare. To all the team on Ward 18, I would like to say 'Top Marks & Thank you'.",0
102127,"My husband had a heart attack following a stoke. The stroke left him unable to speak, partially blind and partly paralysed down the left hand side. His stay in this ward was most distressing - his bed was next to the window and radiator, there were 2 bottles of previous patients urine on the window sill behind the curtain, creating a disgusting smell. In fact the whole area he was in was unclean. Eventually when my husband was collected by myself and daughter, we discovered that he had a bowel movement obviously in hospital pyjamas. It seemed he had not been cleaned and just been put into his trousers to go home. He was in a distressed state and so were we. May I suggest if the heating was reduced and the money was spent on cleaning, infection could be reduced.",0
102270," My husband suffered a severe seizure on 29/6/13, this has been brought on by multiple head trauma after in June 2012. Paramedics great, I feel that when he was taken to A & E, I wasn't listened to. They checked him for heart attack, diabetes and anything other than his head. He was put on a ward and discharged with no diagnosis other than stating seizure. We knew this when the paramedics came. He is confused and totally disorientated but still sent home with no follow up referral. I am now worried there may be scar tissue in the brain, discharged without a head scan is not right.",1
102511," My fella was in agony for 3 days we phoned our local dentist but they couldn't see him until the end of the week, he was in severe pain and wouldn't stop moaning on. I finally convinced him to go to the royal, he was there for two hours it was bliss, finally I got some peace from his agonising moaning, when he come home he was finally smiling clutching his antibiotics and pain killers, it was such a huge releaf, on the plus side of things his pain killers make him sleep throughout the day that's a massive bonus, I would like to say a huge thank you",0

The cosultant came out to greet me personally, they were extremely personable, friendly, thorough and efficient. The examination, investigations and procedures were explained clearly and thoroughly, with plenty of opportunities to ask questions. The health care assistant and nurse in charge were also friendly and efficient.

She hurt her toe and we asked the staff to look at it they didn't for a week and her toe got worse. she wasn't showered regularly so I took some senset skin cleansing foam in and washed her bottom regularly to stop anymore uti;s.

103744," My mother, who had Alzheimer's disease, was admitted with advanced ovarian cancer. She was given very little respect and her relatives even less so. I was told I had no right to know about her treatment and had her record snatched out of my hand at one time. A social worker also told me that my mother was the only one who could make any decision about her care. She wasn't even sure where she was and just kept repeating that she wanted to be with my father, aged 95, who they thought more than capable of her terminal care. I was told by one Registrar ""there's nothing I can do for her - I just want her out of my bed"". We were also told that my mother had a right to know she was dying and so we asked that if this was the case that a member of her family was with her when this was done (not unreasonable?) Arrived on the ward to be told by a nurse that my mother was very distressed have been told that she would die immanently. A doctor had taken it upon themselves to just say to her - ""well you only have a week or so to live - you are dying"". She was then left on her own.

My daughter had an episiotomy but was stitched internally and externally without pain relief, she suffered a great deal of pain, worse than the actual birth. She was eventually allowed to shower to freshen up. She was extremely pale and weak and hadn't eaten for some time. She was left to shower in her room without any nursing assistance, she passed out in the shower due to her weak state and blood loss. Luckily she only hurt her arm and sustained bruises but it could have been much worse. This was her first baby, how would she know the pitfalls?

Fortunately, after much fighting, I was able to get her moved to Amersham Hospital. The care she received in the final days of her life was wonderful. Caring staff who involved the family in every decision. I can't praise this hospital enough, from the nursing staff, Social Worker & OT to the visiting doctor all were wonderful and supportive and made that awful time a little more bearable for us.

After a traumatic miscarriage at home I was taken to A&E and seen by a consultant who told me everything had'gone' and I could go home. 5 months later and many, many visits to the hospital I was finally given a scan and it showed I had retained products, which resulted in an operation. I was told it was my own fault as I had ' refused' an examination from the consultant- not true. I was not offered one neither did I know the consequences of not having one. Dreadful, dreadful care.

Unfortunately, there is a serious weakness in the communications system of the Uorology Department. Over this period, I have received a number of appointment letters for cancer treatment that contained no information about the time and date of the appointments. Each time I have had to telephone to get the required information. The person who makes the appointments does not see the printed letters that are sent out! It seems silly, and a waste of time and money, to post letters of appointment that contain no information.

The social workers were useless wanting him to come home, I have looked after him for years but as I am now elderly myself could not do it.

104840,"My father died in 2011. He lived in his own flat which was supported by a warden. In the winter of 2010 he was rushed to hospital where he stayed for a few days and discharged and sent back to his home. In my opinion, he was discharged too early and was readmitted. In fact he went to Worcester hospital five times in eight weeks. He suffered from strokes but since the fall the strokes became more frequent. Every time he was admitted to hospital he was assessed at my request by hospital social workers. Each time he got discharged from hospital, they issued him with a special stick so that he could pick things up without bending down. He ended up with three of those sticks. My sister visited him every day and helped him to shop. He usually cooked for himself. But after each stroke he was left feeling weaker and weaker until he was admitted to hospital again. We spoke to another social worker and by this time my sister was at breaking point. We were allocated a new social worker who conducted another assessment. At first she said that she didn't think that dad could get any additional support because there was no money as a result of cuts in local authority spending. It felt no one seemed to care. Eventually we had a meeting and agreed to find dad a rest home. He stayed at the Shrubbery nursing home in Kidderminster where he was well looked after until he passed away.",1
104964, I telephoned 'Appointment' at 13.05 to check if my appointment for that day was still on.... 1. First call - they put me through to a fax machine number 2. Second call - the put me through to the wrong Hospital 3. Third call - Appointments could not deal with Neurology appointments as it was on a different system. Spent next 15 minutes transferring/test lines. On auto return to Operator i tried to ask why was i informed to go to Outpatients on my arrival when it seems Appointments cannot check the appointment - a'la Catch 22 4. I was then cut off... ? Total time wasted 47 minutes.. 47 minutes of my money on the phone. I am now having to go to the Hospital and ... whatever.,0
104921," Thank you to all the staff on the Endoscopy Unit excellent care & treatment. The telephone assessment prior to admission is a good idea, saves time & the added complication of parking at the Royal. The procedure for the Endoscopy (with sedation) was unbelievably quick & totally comfortable & painless, the staff including the Consultant who performed the Endoscopy were amazing & give the patient total confidence & allay any fears. Thank you very much from a very anxious Patient prior to the procedure, I need not have worried at all.",0

129681,"My daughter just waited for 5 hours with an acute skin problem affecting her mobility, can't sleep eat or work. GP can't help as knows nothing about skin complaints. NHS direct advised A & E. After waiting and being admitted was told that as she was able to talk to her partner who was with her she must be ok and should go home. The Doctor on duty was rude and obviously knows nothing about skin either In fact he diagnosed her with a muscular skeletal condition a year ago and sent her home, when actually she had a sever chest infection and collapsed the next day.",1
106027,"My mother suffered a massive stroke and we were told almost immediately (after a scan) that she would die, probably in the next couple of days, but there was nothing that could be done. That in itself was handled well. A few days later my wife and I were sat with my mother. Her breathing became increasingly shallow, and eventually the little gasps stopped. Assuming she had actually died, I went to find a nurse and there were several stood around a desk. I quietly begged their pardon and explained that I thought my mother had died, and could someone come and confirm it. The lady who was obviously in charge just turned to me and said ""pardon me, we are in the middle of a meeting"". These were the only nurses on a large 30+ bed ward... I would rather die in a field than have anyone go through that again.",0
106197," I went to the Vision Centre for a standard eye examination. The exam was very thorough, the suite was really nice, modern, air conditioned, hot drinks available. Staff were polite and professional and expert. I have an underlying eye condition so wanted 'proper' checks (not Spec Savers or similar commercial provider). I was so pleased with the qualoty of service I recommended my partner to have her eye exam done there. This was also a positive experience. They bent over backwards to get a pair of reactalite varifocals made up and delivered to our home in time to go away on holiday. All in all, top notch. I can only recommend the service to others, as I have already done so to family.",0
106112," The stars of the event were my wife and new child of course, but close behind was the midwife and her support team. We're nervous parents (who isn't) but through her friendly professionalism, effective management of her support team, continual / informative / attentive two-way communication with mother and father, and great coaching from start to finish, the midwife kept our nerves at bay and guided us to a very successful delivery. Facilities were secure, comfortable (delivery room with en-suite bathroom, communal lounge, kitchen etc.), and very clean / good condition. I wish you the best for your delivery and certainly recommend the Willow Ward at Basildon hospital. Special thanks to the widwife and her colleagues.",0
106333," An appointment was made by my GP in February 2013 to attend LRI (ENT Dept). The initial appointment was for the 2nd April, carried out by a Consultant with 2 students in attendance. A CT scan was arranged for the 3oth April completed satisfactorily. A letter duly arrived stating my next appointment at ENT would be on the 7th August, a subsequent letter arrived in July stating this had been rescheduled for the 17th September, a third letter arrived in late July stating a further rescheduling to the 15th October. After numerous telephone calls to LRI (ENT) all unanswered except one requesting I leave my details for them to call back - no response todate. So much for your performance levels in which you state a figure of 13 weeks, is this another case of number crunching on your behalf. All I would like to know is why the constant delay on my next appointment to ENT. For all I know it is possible that another letter will arrive in August delaying my appointment yet again. From the date my GP arranged my initial appointment to my second appointment at ENT without any treatment so far amounts to 8 months. Yet again you will revert to the same excuses Short staffed/Lack of telephone facilities etc etc,",0
106510," After deeply cutting my knee, I went to durham hospital for it to be cleaned and stitched up. When I was eventually seen I was treated in an unwelcoming manner. My deep wound was poorly cleaned with distiller water. this wa so badly done that mud could still be seen in and around my wound. Rather than stitching my very deep wound, steri strips were placed on it. My wound showed signs of infection within a few hours of leaving the hospital, and when I went back doctors refused I change my badages or clean my wound, the doctor seemed bored and uninterested and simply handed me a prescription for a few doses of penicillin. Not only could I not walk on my leg for two weeks, it took a month for the wound to seal, and due to the infection and poor handling of my knee by the hospital I now have an ugly keloid scar. I am furious with the dismissive manned in which I was treated, and now have a lasting ugly keloid scar that could have easily been avoided.",1
106681, Excellent care and treatment from the first appointment by all disciplines of staff. Clean pleasant environment from clinics at Lancaster Infirmary with caring professional staff. Surgery at Westmorland General was faultless again staff although very busy were both caring and professional. Surgical procedure by consultant again faultless. Scar site minimal. Follow up care excellent so far . Consultant gave clear explanations with plenty of time for questions. Breast care nurses gave plenty of time with contact details. Auxiliary nurse accompanying the clinics was excellent professional and supportive. Very well organised department taking some of the unecassary stress out of the visits.,0
106893,"I found the medical care to be excellent. From the Consultants to the Nursing Staff. I would recommend every time for this. Everything was explained, and you were made to feel that you mattered. The nursing staff were efficient friendly and caring. I was very glad I went there. Down side was, 1. The noise on the ward late at night. Obviously the telephone and nursing station I do not include in this, but when it gets to 11. 15, and there are two televisions blaring away, both showing different programmes, I found that to be unacceptable. This was not every night, but a couple was too much. 2. Food, I likened to 1950's school dinners, stodgy and poor quality. The menu often differed to that on the glossy brochure, e. g. sandwiches which varied from that on offer, usually with some of the filling missing. No fresh fruit, no yoghurt, both clearly offered. Sunday lunch, totally different to that in the menu, juice to start, beef or pork dinner, no alternative, sweet apple pie and custard, no alternative. That said, you aren't there for haute cuisine, just be prepared.",0
129780,My partner had the misfortune at attend this hospital on Wednesday last week and despite presenting with specific problems they seem to have been ignored. She was sent for a doppler test for a dvt despite no symptoms and was seen by an individual in A & E who did not introduce themselves and had no ID. they discharged my partner without telling us what they thought the problem was. On Friday I took her to the MRI in Manchester as a result of the pain that she was in and she was diagnosed with CES a serious spinal neuro problem. After scans and MRIs were carried out she was transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford for emergency surgery. Tamesides inactions could have cost my partner her life at worst or severe disablement at best.,1
107181,"Our father had mixed but generally very good care from doctors at Derriford Hospital since he was diagnosed with chronic renal failure nearly a quarter of a century ago. This included the thorough treatment he received prior to and following a successful Kidney Transplant in 1994. Also it is only proper to reflect positively on the care and attention he received from the many renal nurses and other care assistants/nurses who tended to him over the course of his many visits to hospital, all of whom he held in high regard. Most recently he had a different experience. He was very frustrated and disappointed and had become quite upset and disillusioned about the lack of care and lack of treatment and lack of information he was given following his admission to Derriford Hospital after a fall at home in late January 2013. This included him being discharged briefly for a week in late February and in my opinion ultimately led to his untimely death in late March 2013. Our father's sense of frustration had grown as he had been explaining since last summer to doctors about feeling extreme fatigue and a complete lack of energy and this had left him feeling light headed and weak. This symptom had only materialised after he had begun Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis at home. After beginning CAPD, he seemed to feel as if he was being left to his own devices and when he complained of fatigue and having no energy, he was told simplistically to exercise more. His complete lack of energy and weariness was what eventually led in late January to him falling at home as he lost consciousness whilst trying to make a cup of tea. In my opinion Doctor A did not treat our father properly initially after his admission in late January. This included giving him a 6 day course of antibiotics (which seems surprisingly brief) for pneumonia on the left lung and then authorising his premature discharge in late February. Doctor A ignored our Fathers plea to examine his left lung pain and shortness of breath down to the diagnosis of two displaced ribs on the left side. It felt that our father's treatment was chaotic and dangerous seemingly due to failure of the Doctor A's lack of clear communication. Our father was often left dehydrated, with bleeding limbs due to apparent negligence and poor man handling from some doctors. Our Father only was addressed properly and informed of the current “trial treatment” when I took his doctors to task on their lack of professionalism and compassion towards my Father's well being and recovery. Myself, my brother and our Father felt that we were never fully informed of our Father's treatment or reason for it, only that they were doing everything they could. However I do beg to differ on this point as within our Fathers last 24 hours numerous doctors from different departments were asked to see our Father to run numerous tests ie bone marrow samples. We do not understand why these tests had not been run earlier, particularly as it fuelled our family with false hope as the test results would take 7 days to return. Sadly after his readmission due to breathing difficulties, the doctors we met on Mayflower Ward themselves seemed without much idea generally. Our father was particularly frustrated with Doctor B who he said was aloof and uncommunicative. When we observed Doctor B during his ward rounds a few days before my father died, he seemed quite unperturbed by our father's clearly worsening condition and claimed to be treating his chest infection ‘empirically' on what proved to be less than 48 hours before his death. We feel that our father was treated poorly during what proved to be his last visit to Derriford Hospital, and our experiences since his death have apparently confirmed the shoddy approach of some of the staff. We have both tried to liaise with the bereavement team at Derriford Hospital after our initial meeting with them the day after our father died, at which we gave permission for an autopsy to be completed. We gave our consent for a post mortem examination and sample to be taken on the understanding this would determine what had caused the chest infection and inform the doctors prior to our meeting with them to discuss those results. The doctors themselves wanted to know what had caused our father's death as they did not seem to know. Five months have now elapsed since we gave our consent for this procedure and we have not had information. We feel like we have been deliberately ignored and our attempts to ascertain what has happened are being frustrated, and we are left wondering why this is the case? We have sent in a complaint letter but the due date that the hospital set themselves to get back to us has expired. This seems to us not only unprofessional and to demonstrate a lack of care and thought for grieving relatives, but also seems symptomatic of the directionless treatment we believe our father received. It would seem at best to indicate an organisation that is incompetent and totally dysfunctional and is deeply troubling. The bereavement team have not kept us informed about what has happened. We have requested a meeting with Doctor B so we can discuss the results from the autopsy together but have heard nothing. It was only the intervention of the Critical Care Team, who arrived on Mayflower Ward to accompany our father for an Xray who intervened and stopped what we regarded as being inhumane treatment. A junior doctor had the decency to apologise for this when we went to the hospital the day after our father died. This well meaning but inadequate response is all we have received by way of an explanation.",1
107637, My Mother has recently died on Jubilee Ward at Stroud General Hospital. The Nurses and Doctors treated her with kindness and respect at all times. She died peacefully with her family around her.The staff couldn't do enough for us and gave us all the time we needed to say our precious goodbyes. Care like this would be hard to beat and I am so thankfull that my Mum was allowed the privilege of being in the hands of such dedicated Health Professionals. Losing her has been heartbreaking but we are comforted to know that she died in such a dignified manner. Special Thanks to your incredible caring team.,0
107978," I was recently admitted to the emergency medical centre when I reported to Whipps Cross Hospital with chest pains and a history of heart attack. I cannot fault the efficiency of staff and the care I received and the follow up care has been excellent too. If I have any criticism it is to echo comments by another reviewer that perhaps thought should be made to provide segregated accommodation for patients who cause disturbance to others due to dementia or other mental illness. It can be stressful enough having to stay in hospital and you expect a certain amount of disturbance while staff are admitting and/or caring for other patients, especially in emergency or acute wards, but constant shouting, screaming etc. by some patients can be very stressful to others and severely affect their well-being and recovery. Trying to sleep in a strange bed in stressful circumstances can be hard enough anyway so being awakened by someone with mental illness shouting and hollering all night makes recovery that more difficult. During my stay one female patient screamed and yelled constantly for nearly 24 hours. She was in an adjacent ward with other patients and when I looked in the doorway the others were clearly distressed by the noise she was making but staff just seemed to ignore her and their distress. Then an elderly lady was brought into my ward who was clearly mentally unstable and kept shouting out too. This is bad enough in a ward where you are going to be moved elsewhere or discharged but on wards where you face a longer stay something really needs to be done to separate these ""nuisance"" patients.",0
107943, Daughter in law was booked for an induction on 12th August as she was 12 days overdue. She rang up in the morning and they told her it was ok for her to come in only to find that she ended up in a normal ward all day not the labour ward as there were no spaces. Induction never happened that day and my son had to leave his crying wife overnight because if she left she might lose her slot for her waters to be broken. 7 o'clock the following morning her waters were broken but due to fetal distress the baby excreted his first pooh which can be extremely dangerous and even fatal. Baby is being monitored and none of us know if the baby will be ok as she is still in labour. My son said he felt the staff treated him as if he was some sort of wife beater and should not have been there and now due to their delay baby may suffer. I am disgusted at the way they have been treated so far,1
108223,"I order catheters from your service. It's inconvenient to ring your number. I prefer contacting the supplier direct, there is a day's delay in delivery due to using this service. Also several months ago I was questioned about my order and if I needed them. I do not appreciate discussing my personal affairs with someone who is not a trained GP. My health issues and prescription requirements are between me and my GP and no one else. Also, I requested the facility to send requests by email. I was advised I would have to call in to the hospital to set this up. This is an off way of setting up such a service and an inconvenience. It should be possible to do it online.",0
108571," My girlfriend was taken into A&E after having a asthma attack at work. Below is quick summary of the timeline. - Arrived at A&E by Ambulance @ 12 noon - Temperature, blood pressure and pulse taken after 20 minute wait. - Seen at 1.25pm by consultant. - Blood taken for testing (quoted 1 hour for results). - Went for lunch, came back to hospital at 2.50pm - results not ready. - Moved to Ward J22 (Clinical Decisions Unit) at 3.30pm - Finally got results at 4.25pm. Overall the experience was a frustrating one with lots of waiting around, either to see a doctor or for test results. Another annoying thing was having to repeat info to the doctor that should be readily available by looking at GP notes. Surely in 2013 doctors should be able to access your medical history electronically to help inform their decisions, rather than having to explain the whole situation over and over. - The new multi-storey car park at the hospital is great, but it's crazy that you can't pay for parking by debit card (cash only). - It would be handy if the hospital had WiFi service. - I noticed quite a few 'Give us your feedback' comment card boxes around the hospital which seems like quite a old fashioned way of getting feedback. Why not just refer people to NHS Choices to leave a review online instead? Maybe text people a link to the website after being discharged?",0
108672,"I was put on Warfarin. My regular dose is 5mg and, until recently, I just had to take one pink 5mg tablet. Due to concerns about confusing the 0. 5mg [white] tablet with the 5mg [pink] tablet they have BOTH been withdrawn and I now have to take 3 tablets daily [one 3mg and two 1mg] instead of one. I have contacted the NHS Anglia Commissioning Support Unit who are now responsible for this policy which my GP practice is following but have come up against a brick wall of intransigence. I have suggested that if the 0. 5mg tablet alone was withdrawn and the 5mg tablet reinstated then there is NO POSSIBILITY of confusion or mis-prescribing. It seems to me that they have made a decision and are not prepared to review it with, what I would call, a modicum of common sense. I feel they are also going against the recommendations of the NHS Patient Safety Agency Patient Safety Alert 18 which says in section 8 that to promote safer use prescriptions should ""use the least number of tablets each day"".",0
109176," Some months ago my elderly father suffered a stroke and in the process of being taken into hospital his hearing aid was broken. Whilst in hospital (not NMGH) he became quite upset at being unable to hear staff and visitors, which exacerbated his general distress. When my father was discharged I accompanied him to an appointment at NMGH Audiology Unit in hopes of getting his damaged hearing aid repaired or replaced, and the staff were so kind and helpful, it is clear that they fully appreciate how isolated a person with impaired hearing can feel. I cannot highly enough praise their dedication and consideration and I know my father feels the same.",0
109305," I have attended the hospital to have a couple of blood tests. I've always found a parking space okay, and the greeting staff have been so friendly in guiding me to the right place! The test itself is done really efficiently, you need to take a ticket from the machine next to the door then await your number being called. The nurses taking the samples are efficient and quick. I've been in and out both times within half an hour, so didn't need to pay for parking really as it's free for the first 30 mins! Great service and fantastic, clean facility, no complaints at all!",0
109271, Very clean and tidy mobile van. Lovely staff. No waiting.... max 20 mins from parking up to leaving. Staff very reassuring and friendly during the procedure . Excellent service. Big thank you to all. Sadly the car parking was £3.00 for 3 hours minimum. Day light robbery. Have filed a complaint as I feel this is much too expensive for the majority. Many people go for regular blood test and minor tests so this car parking company are making a fortune. Manchester airport long stay parking is only £3.50 per 24 hours! Since arriving home I have noticed that there's a reply from car parking firm stating that for short visits there is no need to pay! I may have missed this on the machine notice but don't think so. The least the company (whoever they are) can do is make it obvious how long you get free parking in the car park.,0
109563," To whom it may concern, My Granddad is currently being treated at Shrewsbury Hospital. He has advanced Parkinson's disease and he was admitted on Monday after a fall at home. He was found to have a very bad chest infection and was being treated so that it wouldn't develop into Pneumonia. As he couldn't swallow he was unable to take his Parkinson's medication,drink or eat and was placed on a drip. Because he couldn't take his Parkinson's tablets he was hallucinating badly and having some very frightening visions. Leading up to Wednesday 21st August he was having a lot of difficulty breathing and my Grandma and Aunty noticed that his top teeth were missing and were concerned he had swallowed them. He had an x-ray and the doctor confirmed there was nothing in his throat. I visited Granddad along with other family members on Saturday 24th August in the evening and it was very upsetting to see him, he was feeding himself invisible food and seeing other things that weren't there and was very confused, frightened and disoriented. His drip had been removed at around 3pm when my sisters visited and still hadn't been replaced at 8pm when I came to leave. As he was nil by mouth this meant he had had no fluids or nutrients for 5 hours. I discovered today that the drip hadn't been replaced until 10.30pm that evening. My Aunty stayed with him Saturday evening and had to call the nurses at 3.30am Sunday morning because he was in real distress and after another x-ray they discovered his top teeth lodged down his throat! I am absolutely disgusted with the way he has been treated and would welcome a discussion with a senior member of staff when I visit tomorrow Monday 26th August at 2pm. We were told yesterday that the specialists he needed to see were not available because it was a bank holiday . . ? do people stop getting sick because it is bank holiday? I look forward to hearing from someone. Regards Melissa (Granddaughter of Mr Norman M, 5th Floor, Ward 28)",1
109579," Last August my father, in his 80s, was taken into Stafford A&E by paramedics as he was in terrible pain with his gut, not a little pain but agony! He was given an ECG which showed that his heart was fine. He was given the usual chest xray - which again was fine - as it would be - it was his stomach that was giving him trouble but no-one seemed to listen to that! He was sent out told he was probably constipated and to take paracetamol! The pain eased but then later returned. After being diagnosed as such at Stafford my father was reluctant to bother them again but my mother, thank goodness, insisted on a second opinion and asked for him to be seen at New Cross. This was a different experience! He was quickly diagnosed with a blockage. A wonderful surgeon operated and removed his colon - it was Colon Cancer. It had spread to his liver but with the excellent care and skill of surgeons and nurses at New Cross and QE it has all been removed. How can trained drs miss something that is obvious to others? I live very near to Stafford Hospital and if, God forbid, I needed emergency care I'd beg the ambulance to take me to New Cross! I really cannot praise that hospital enough!",1
109672," I was very impressed with the facilities and service at ECTC, particularly as the procedure I required was quite complicated. The skill of the Consultant and Doctor was absolutely amazing. I was equally impressed with the nursing services, what an incredible and professional team all round. I just wish the ECTC centre was better located rather than being at the wrong end of the county. In particular I would recommend using the accommodation which is available with support from the ECTC, as this ensures you can arrive at the early 7am admission without any additional stress.",0

Friendly polite receptionist booked me in and directed me to the waiting area which was comfortable and complete with TV/mags/cold water dispenser.

110376," My father who is 78 with multiple myeloma and Parkinson's fell on saturday 10 August and broke his hip. In the early hours of Sunday 11 August he was admitted to ward 12, where he received disgraceful and unacceptable treatment and care. As a result of his multiple myeloma and Parkinson's he has to take numerous drugs at various times. He has had myeloma and Parkinson's for many years and he is extremely competent at taking his drugs. He was woken at about 6am on Monday 12 August by an agency nurse. She began to dispense drugs for my Dad. My Dad politely requested that she stop dispensing all of them, as he only takes Bonefos and an antacid tablet at 6am in the morning. He tried to explain this to her but she wouldn't listen and continued to dispense all his tablets for the whole day. My Dad said he couldn't take them all at once. He requested to see a Doctor. He said he wouldn't take them with out seeing a Doctor as the combination of them all could be detrimental. The agency nurse went to speak to another nurse. One of these nurses then spoke to my Dad disgracefully, humiliatingly and aggressively. She told him that unless he took them she would throw them away. She degraded him, humiliated him and reduced a very vulnerable patient to tears. She didn't even give him any privacy, she let the whole ward know what was happening as other patients were even commenting on the situation which added to my Dads humiliation and upset. The way he was treated amounted to verbal bullying! As she wouldn't fetch a doctor or lock the medication back in the secure draw next to his bed, she did throw the drugs away. One of the drugs she threw away was Lenalidomide which is £250 a tablet! So she wasted valuable NHS resources. She then left my Dad crying and took no steps to comfort him. My Dad said he had never felt so upset or humiliated in his life and not a single person took any steps to comfort him! This is absolutely unacceptable and disgusting! This act severely affected my Dads confidence and self esteem! Due to his myeloma he needs to drink large amounts of water to help prevent a protein build up in his urine. He was nil by mouth until Sunday afternoon, as he was being operated on, however, he was not given anything to drink on Monday until my Mum arrived at visiting time, which was about 3pm. He was on the ward for nearly 24 hours without a drink. This is depriving a patient of a very basic right! He was also left in the toilet for over half an hour even though he had rung for assistance! He had only just had an operation and he was left in a toilet where he could have fallen or fainted resulting in him seriously hurting himself. He also asked in A&E that his myeloma consultant would be contacted as a broken bone could affect his myeloma. This was never done! There was a serious failure in communication and care. The myeloma consultant should have been consulted!",1

110867," I visited Hillingdon Hospital A&E with a long-standing friend aged 86 years who had had a fall, suffering bruises and abrasions but no breaks. She has a strong dislike of hospitals and was determined not to stay overnight, despite everyone urging her to do so as she obviously could not walk and had no support at home, as she lives alone. The staf were unbelievably patient, treated her with compassion and dignity despite her lack of co-operation, and eventually persuaded her to stay. - a superhuman effort on their part! I wrote to the Chief Executive praising the staff, particularly the locum consultant registrar. I do not doubt that my friend was equally unco-operative on the ward. She returned home the following morning, to support from carers. However, sadly, she fell again three days later and is now an inpatient in Hillingdon Hospital, where I have visited her daily. Again I have witnessed much kindness from staff in dealing with her. No one wants to be in hospital, but I feel she has received exemplary care.",0
110871," Healthcare professionals worked well together to set and maintain a focussed yet relaxed environment whilst I had an intimate examination. The hospital's location contributes to my irregular exercise regime and you have to be reasonably fit to access the Outpatient Services which are at a distance from the Main Reception. However I contribute this somewhat tongue in cheek because any opportunity to burn some calories is worthwhile, especially when there's the added stimulation of a main corridor exhibiting local art and photography, and I can be reasonably confident of timely and thoughtful care by staff at this hospital. PS I visited the Medical Imaging Department today - they're not listed in Section 4",0
111492," I spent three weeks in this hospital and the treatment was excellent. However, for much of the time I was in a ward with other elderly men who were very ill or dying. In fact two died within a few weeks. One was shouting out in pain and one was vommiting and there was at times a stench of excrement. This atmosphere honestly caused me to think that I had been put there to die even though I was told that I was recovering well. (I was even making arrangements for my funeral). The whole ward was one of death and decay and the lights were dimmed for much of the day. The care and the nurses and the food and evrything else was wonderful except for the atmosphere of death and decay. I thought nothing about this until a young adult man told me that when he was in the same hospital recovering from a sports injury all was light and bright and cheerful with recovery as the keynote. No moaning and groaning and vommitting and dying. and dimmed lights during daytime.. One month later he visited his grandfather (66) in the same hospital and found things very different. He told me 'It seemed like they lump all the older men together whether they were recovering from a minor illness or dying of a serious illness'. I think he may be correct. Informal enquiries seem to suggest that the age segregation of adults is now common practice in the uk. I wondered why everyone in the ward was probably aged over 60 and why there were no younger men there.",0
111504, My mother has just had a spell in the intensive care unit in Wythenshawe having been transferred from Stepping Hill. This hospital is worlds apart from Stepping Hill Hospital who made mistake after mistake. Wythenshawe Hospital have looked after my mother extremelly well and treated with the upmost care and attention. Before going into intensive care she was in the A&E department who also did an excellent job and between the two departments probably saved my mothers life as the situation was very grave and she was not expected to live the night. I can't express how happy I am to have my mother in this hospital and will never let her go to Stepping Hill Hospital again.,0
111670," I was shocked while visiting a good friend,first thing to greet me was the smell of stale air and bodys,instead of clean wards smelling of disinfectant that we used to smell on entering a hospital,the ward looked like a bomb had hit it.then to find my friend with phlem in his mouth and dried blood around his lips,blood stained dressing on his arm,the butterfly intravienus on his hand coming loose and dropped off when he moved because it had never been looked at or replaced since admission 8days previous,all of these things just basic care,instead of neglect,i felt so sorry for him and his wife .",1
111749,"My dad was in Ward 7a for 4 weeks. I thought the ward was disgusting. My poor father is a different man. Care was not given was never diagnosed properly for what he went in for and was discharged in a worse state of health than when he went in. My story and complaint is too long! Cutting a long long story short after 4 weeks in bed with no physio or anything he was discharged! No care plan in place nothing we were just left to cope. My young at heart father had to be put in a care home and after 2 weeks because he was still ill on wrong medication which the Royal prescribed he was admitted yesterday to Countess of Chester Hospital severe dehydration breathlessness. He was taken off all his medication and they have just got his stats up as taking beta blockers duretics for heart complaint he did not have! ! He is a different person he's not like my dad anymore he has been traumatised! He's now on a gastoentology ward in the Countess where he should have been when he was in Royal because the complaint was a blocked ilestomy! Countess could not believe that he was discharged in that state with severe muscle wastage etc etc he couldn't even walk! ! In my opinion, this is a disgrace.",1
111807," Signage at the hospital is appalling, there are no directions to where the visitor drop off points are or how to reach them, even the map on the website doesn't indicate where they are, there is just 101 disabled parking bays near the entrance. Car parking charges are equally astronomical. It's cheaper to park in Darlington city centre, you shouldn't have to pay for a minimum of 2 hours when all I was doing is dropping someone off and taking them in to day surgery (max of 15-20 mins). Charge by 30 min period or make all parking free for the first 20 mins. The hospital trust certainly know how to fleece the public.",0
130191,"I had to take my 3 year old son to urgent care on 15/09/13. Triage Nurses were fantastic, the Doctor was horrendous! Misdiagnosed my son with cellulitis and insinuated that it was caused by our neglecting to clean his genitals properly. Really made me feel like we had neglected our son. This misdiagnosis resulted in a trip to Durham A&E, referred by 111. And then an ambulance blue light trip to RVI. Thankfully this misdiagnosis has not caused serious problems, but I dread to think what would have happened it I didn't have the confidence to go to A&E and it had been something more serious. I will never trust this Urgent Care unit with my family's health!",1

I needed some attention to a wound from a recent operation and contacted NHS 111, via the telephone instructions provided on the Taverham Partnership web-site. I was provided with an immediate appoint at the Norwich Community Hospital, where the out-of-hours doctor referred me (with letter) to the Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital, where the problem was quickly resolved. From making the initial call at ~7: 30, I was back home by ~10: 30. Excellent systems and care services. Thank you.",0

My treatment at the Bickerstaff Clinic was superb, nursing staff and nurse practitioner when carried out procedure were kind, cheerful and professional. My only comment was I had to wait 1 1/2 hours as I opted for spray not anesthetic. I was told no problems found on the day and that biopsy test results would go to my GP. Excellent service! 2) I had physio in September. Excellent appointment, very good reception. Jo the physio was very thorough and explained procedures well. Another appointment for next week. Extremely pleased with this department.",0
112420," Father in law declined rapidly over the weekend, was told we could not see a doctor. When asked how he was overnight was told he kept everyone awake and was difficult to deal with. I was also told his liver condition by an unqualified nurse related to alcohol abuse ( he does not drink) He was confused and hallucinating, to my mind from a. Urine infection which they had stopped tablets on the Friday. I insisted on a doctor who eventually prescribed antibiotics. I also insisted on a fluid drip as he was incapable of drinking himself and the nurses did not assist him drinking. Monday he was much improved, I seriously question that without family intervention nothing would have happened until Monday. They are thinking of sending him home, he cannot walk, feed himself, go to the toilet unaided. No one bothered to ask us what his home situation was like, instead they took the rumblings of an 86 yr man who is confused . We are now waiting for social worker to get involved.

113544," I had the unfortunate task of having to call an ambulance to a very drunk housemate who was inhaling his own vomit, and subsequently attended A+E with him. The staff there treated him with the utmost dignity and respect, despite his illness quite clearly being self inflicted and avoidable. He was kept in overnight as he was deemed unsafe to go home, and was looked after well by the staff. I would definitely recommend the service to other patients, the staff are a credit to their professions and to the Hospital Trust.",0
130303,My 63 year old mother was admitted in May 2013 and died of sepsis caused by a Urinary Tract Infection that she contracted whilst in the hospital. Sadly I felt extremely let down by her care during her stay and have made a formal complaint. I do not feel that the Consultant treated my mother or my family with compassion and I consider her death was avoidable given that I raised several alarms about her deterioration over the bank holiday weekend that were ignored until it was too late. I was never even told that she had contracted Sepsis until I opened her death certificate. The Consultant involved attempted to pressurise me into withdrawing food and fluids from her before she had even been diagnosed and I was appalled that such a practice is acceptable in our hospitals. I would urge anyone with relatives that are patients here to keep a close on them and record and document any concerns as soon as they arise. I witnessed many other patients ringing their bells to seek assistance with going to the toilet only to be ignored or left for over an hour. It is a very sad and regrettable state of affairs and I hope that improvements will be made.,1

I am very proud of my team, the service we strive to deliver, the support we offer each other and the improvements we are committed to making.

113701," Had a horrific experience on the prenatal / post natal ward and making a complaint. Rude staff who seem to have forgotten they are being paid and they are at work as professionals. Slammed door in our faces Said they would move a mother in labour to the labour ward and only came back to move her after two hours of being neglected after I complained strongly to tell us their problems and excuses for their neglect when they should have monitored her induced baby constantly. Told a mother she was not allowed to go home as to busy to examine her and bullied other young mothers into breast feeding, even when asked for a bottle for their crying new born who had after many hours still not been fed almost forced a mother to express breast milk when she had clearly said she wanted to bottle feed her baby, spoke to tired young mothers like children who were misbehaving, making two tired exhusted mothers in our ear shot cry. Refused to tell me her name when I wanted to complain about her rude ways. Actually said one young mother wasn't allowed to go and tried to intimidate her by saying she was putting her baby at risk even tho baby had been checked by pediatrican and had the all clear to go home. Rolled their eyes and refused to get a matron or some one senior so we could complain. Total disgrace to the NHs and need to be retrained maybe a job for Gordon Ramsay as this was close to hell. I intend to complain and to complain loud and clearly to the trust and I encourage all other women treated so badly on this ward to do the same. On a positive note the midwifes on the actual labour ward were professional,positive and very caring.",1
113989," My daughter injured her hand at school and saw the school nurse who didn't think it a serious injury. My husband and I were also satisfied that it was not serious. She didn't complain of pain at home but that it hurt at school after writing. She went to the school nurse for medication. On the fourth day, for my peace of mind, I took her to the minor injury unit and saw a nurse. Her tone from the beginning was impatient and sharp. She asked me if I had 'child protection issues in my home'. I understand her duty to safeguard children but I feel her choice of words could have been more respectful and sensitive. She agreed that the injury was not serious and needed time to heal but in a very aggressive tone she reprimanded me for not giving my daughter more painkillers. She did this in the presence of my teenage daughter. I felt devastated at her implied accusation that I had neglected to give my daughter the necessary medical care. Worst of all I felt undermined as a parent. Maybe I misjudged the pain relief that was necessary but I feel it was unprofessional of the nurse to discredit my parental care in front of my child. My daughter at times has made a bigger fuss of injuries than their severity warranted, so my husband and I were reluctant to medicate unnecessarily. She also refused a sling to support her arm so we were unsure of the extent of her pain that she was having at school. I am distressed by this whole episode, and the nurse didn't even end the consultation with a polite 'good bye'.",0

114346," My son was taken to Heartlands by ambulance after being assaulted, he was unconcious for 20 mins with a head injury. It took the staff several hours to do a CT scan. When he eventually got one, they completley missed that he had a fracture to his Pectous bone and lower brain contutions!? He complained about the pain in his head and brightness of the lights. The day staff took over and a nurse put on the lights and told my son that this was not a hotel, there is nothing wrong with him and that he needed to free up the bed for real patients and go home and sleep off his hangover!? My son was admitted to QE hospital after another ct scan, they found he had a fracture and bleed on the brain. He is on the neurosurgery ward. In light of all what is going on with the poor care in some NHS hospitals it beggers belief that nurses still show no empathy or respect that the patient may be right if they are saying they are in pain!

114334, I attended for a colonoscopy yesterday and was very satisfied with all aspects of the service. The service was professional and treated with me respect at all times. The process was transparent at all times. Staff were understanding of anxiety issues and I received a telephone call today (next day) from one of the team to both check on my condition and understanding of the findings and the next steps. As stated I was very satisfied with all aspects of the service. If there was an 'outstanding' category I would apply this 'Staff co-operation' Dignity and respect' and 'Invovlement in decisions'.,0

The only delay, which I must say was excessive, was waiting for an X-ray. This does not reflect on the A & E department but in the organization of the South Wing X-ray department. I wish to reiterate my praise for the doctors, nurses & porters in the A & E department. I can rate their performance as 100%",0
114584," Im writing this on behalf of my Mother in Law who died after 10 weeks in this Hospital and who now cant write this for herself but wanted to. She was admitted with a urine infection but after 8 weeks they still had not identified she had a 10cm cancerous mass in her bladder! Having received her medical notes, She fell out of bed twice, once on the ITU ward! She was dropped once during toileting, frequently went without food or drinks unless I was there, was given tablets to swallow even though she could not swallow them. Was told she was being discharged even though she was, vomiting, bleeding, confused and had an infection. Missed three referral appointments to a specialist because she was not well enough to go to the appointment but the Consultant refused to come and see her in the Hospital because her appointments were as an ""out-patient""! This delayed her diagnosis until we started making a big fuss. In short her treatment was appalling and nothing short of disgusting. The hospital refused to release her to a Hospice so we had to sign a letter to remove her and once we did they stopped giving her any pain relief or fluids. We witnessed other patients calling for the nurse and being ignored unless a relative was there or a visitor tried to help them. The nurse would just sit at the nurses station and look at them knowing they needed a bed pan. patients food would just sit there untouched for those unable to feed themselves as there was no one to give it to the patients unless a family member came in. One patient escaped to the carpark before the staff knew they were gone!",1
114625,I had an awful pregnancy and eventually diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. Due to being severely unwell I had to be transferred from Good Hope Hospital to Coventry University Hospital and our son was delivered by caesarean section at 27 weeks gestation weighing 990 grams. Aged 2 days old he and I were transferred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where they cared for our son in intensive care within their neonatal unit.

114897, This is on behalf of my Mum who was admitted to MDGH with a suspected stroke earlier this year from her care home. She had become hypersensitive and extremely confused and I was upset to see staff trying to take blood from her whilst she was obviously in extreme pain. I asked them to leave her until I could try and reassure her. I was continually told that she had dementia which I knew she didn't and I kept trying to tell staff that she had an infection of some sort as she had behaved this way previously after a very serious stroke in Sept 2012. She was moved to another ward as it became apparent that she hadn't had a stroke and did have an infection. She was in a side ward but the window was ill fitting - it was a very cold spell and wind and snow blew through Mum's window. She wasn't given a blanket. No one appeared to know that she had suffered a stroke and asked why she couldn't get to the toilet! If I hadn't been there goodness knows what would have happened. She was then diagnosed with a gall bladder infection - if her notes had been reviewed medical staff would have known that she had a history of gall bladder problems. I sent clean clothes with my elderly father the next day only to find that she had been discharged back to her care home on cold day with just her nightie and dressing down and of course she was still confused and no-one had thought to let us know. All in all a dreadful experience and one which I hope I never have to see again.,1
114916," Went here with the other half for our 12 week ultrasound scan. Firstly, to book the scan we had to ring a premium rate number (0844 902 0004). Cost me about £5 for the call from my mobile after being kept on hold for ages. After doing a bit of research online, it looks like 01924 20512266 is the local number to book in for a Ultrasound scan. On arriving we found that all the car parks are pay and display (£1.70 for an hour), however both ticket machines were broken so we didn't bother. Despite booking an appointment for 1pm, we waited until 1.10pm despite being only 1 of 2 couples in the waiting room. The nurse doing the scan didn't really engage in any kind of conversation, which made the whole experience feel very impersonal. Also we had to pay £5 to get a picture of the baby scan to take home. Altogether cost me over a tenner for something which should be free as i've already paid for it in tax! As for the hospital itself, it looks like it hasn't seen a refurb since the late 60's, with the whole place feeling very old and decrepit. We'll be giving Pindefields a try for the next scan!",0
115350," I recently had an appointment at physiotherapy, and paid £1.50 parking, (£1.20 per hour no change given).I was not expecting to be any more than 1 hour. However, I was referred from physio to A&E, where I remained for another 2 hours and had to report back to physio. Upon my return to the car I put in another £1.50. The notice on the 'money machine' also states that up to 20 minutes is free. So I have paid £3.00, was there for 3 hours and 5 minutes, perhaps 20 minutes could have been free??? However, today a fine of £40.00, £70.00 if not paid within 14 days has come through my door. If you phone the number that is supplied you get a recorded message telling you how to pay-no real person at the end. So to cut a long story short, I am not happy, feel that I have paid for parking, although probably 60p short, by their reckoning. I will now write to the local press and to the Chief Executive to inform them of my (and no doubt many others) displeasure. This is an absolutely appalling way to treat patients and visitors alike who may not be aware of their length of stay",0
115431,"My daughter was admitted to pilgrim. Her canula was left bleeding for hours. The staff denied this. I later found a picture on my late daughter's mobile with canula in situ bleeding and in the background is the ward name. Yet they denied this in a complaint reply. How disgusting. Also my daughter saw a doctor who did not prescribe supplement drinks although we recommended these. Yet she became so weak she stopped walking. He thought she had an eating disorder, which she denied. Yet she died of chronic diseases, I believe my darling daughter was let down by doctors who get paid to treat and diagnose illnesses. The whole situation is heartbreaking and disgusting. In my opinion these doctors have failed in their duty of care and should be struck off. Shame on them.",1
115572, I gave birth to my son here and I have to say the staff were horrendous. I was not treated with any kind of respect or dignity and was even made to feel as though I was an inconvenice. At one point I was even reffered to as forceps rather than by my name. At such a vulnerable time for any women I was completely shell shocked at the treatment I received. I discharged myself early after my son had been checked over and then was subjected to two midwives at my front door questioning why I had left my son at the hospital. When I showed the midwives my son sleeping soundly in his cot they offered NO apology. Utterly disgraceful care. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone!,0
115674," The care my husband received at RSH was appalling, symptoms ignored, bloods ignored, diabetes ignored, doctors refusing to listen. This occurred on first admission of 8 days discharged from hospital in a worse condition that entered. Readmitted 6 days later and the very same thing happened again. I his wife had to demand and start shouting to get anything done, this involved 5 doctors 3 wards. My husband was in or nearly a month and in that time witnessed not only his appalling care but many others. There appears to be a systemic lack of care, communication and doctors seam to govern themselves. And when you do complain you see the shuttered coming down very quickly.",1
115916," I was treated abominably by this hospital. I'd had MS for a number of years but was still undiagnosed, and the doctors treated me as though I was a mental case. They told me that all my tests were normal and therefore my condition must be ""psychological"". It was only later I realised that they'd scanned my brain but omitted to scan my spinal cord. So I paid for my own MRI, and this showed white matter lesions at five different levels of my spinal cord. On sending for my hospital notes, I discovered that there had been something on my brain scan too, but they'd ignored it, because it was only one lesion and quite small. Those doctors knew how desperate I was to have my illness believed, and yet they'd falsely told me there was nothing on the brain scan when there was. I also found they'd misdiagnosed me with ""hypochondria"" and ""anxiety state"". It's not uncommon for MS people to have their illness disbelieved during the early stages, but a specialist neurological hospital really ought to know better.",1

Everything including the preparation was really well explained and literature given to me was very clear and simple to follow. I went to the Beynon centre for the examination this week and my observations are: a) the centre is really clean and efficiently run - from the warm welcome at the reception desk, all through the pre-examination checks, the analysis and examination, feedback from the doctor, the after care in the ward and discharge from the centre. b) I was kept informed all through the process on what would happen next which reduced my level of anxiety a lot c) the team who looked after me were an excellent team and extremely user friendly I really appreciated the help and support for this check from all the New Cross departments involved (even the guys who set up the examination appointment by telephone were very helpful) and would like to take this opportunity to thank all those involved.

My observations (benchmarking against Scandinavia), applies also to Nottingham and Huntingdon hospitals that my family has used in last 5 years. 1) In general - everything is free (not in Scandinavia) - people are friendly - but it looks and feels that you are back in 60s 2) Hygienic ( related to 'hospital super bacteria' - that also increases NSN costs) - overall cleanness and e. g. toilets are nowadays clearly improved (compared 10 years ago); level of good quality pub but not level of a good restaurant - doctors are working, coming and leaving hospital in their personal clothes => so bacterias are also coming and going freely with them in their clothes - nurses do the same with their uniforms This is not a budget thing but a mind set. A lot to improve compared to Scandinavia. 3) Process efficiency - during the first day my wife needed to give the same personal details, her medication details, health and allergy etc. details for 8 times for 8 different people ( nurses and doctors). - all this will take a lot of time from them to first write on paper and the. To their computing system - this time is out of the time doctors and nurses could spend with their customers (patients); maybe even some of that could be saved by reduced personnel - in any case there must a computer system plan in place to enable everybody (relevant for care process per patient); just copy proudly from some more advanced EU country and don't develop your own; you will be just cheated again - meanwhile hire minimum salary people to ask and fill the data to NHS systems and release nurses and doctors to do what they are trained for and good at Summary UK people complain too much NHS. Maybe big differencies based on postcode where you are living ... but in general in my Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire experience I would say UK NHS is one of the best in the world. Surely the cheapest for patients. But even that can improved as identified above. I would benchmark with few EU countries the NHS number of admin and management people and their salaries on average per patient - and I would bet that the biggest cost savings are there.",0

However the staff that were there did not listen to me and we're incredibly uncomforting during one of the most painful experiences I would go through in my life. Giving birth at croydon university hospital was the biggest mistake I made. After I gave birth I knew there was something wrong and that I was bleeding beyond the normal amount. I told a number of midwives but they just dismissed it and ignored me. Once I came home I suffered from severe postnatal depression and it was because I was feeling so low and unwell. I started having blackouts and dizziness at home and I spoke to the midwife who visited me at home who again too said it was possibly due to tiredness and PND. I finally called the ambulance and went to hospital myself feeling even worse for having to leave my baby at home with my mum only 2days old. Once I got to the hospital I found out that there was a piece of placenta left in me and it was becoming poisonous. The bleeding was because my body was trying to fight off the infection. The truth was attempted to be concealed from me as I only learned the full truth when another midwife visited me as a follow up check up the next morning. It was my first child and I will never forget the distress and trauma the faults of the hospital caused me. As soon as the piece of placenta was taken out of me my PND went away so I know that it was the cause of my depression! I hope no other mother experiences what I did. Child birth should be a happy memory although painful but should never be what I experienced!,1
116917," Ticket machine in visitors car park 2 has been out of action for 10 days now, and when used second machine it wouldn't accept 10p coins. Pressed cancel to get my remaining money back but it simply swallowed my money and issued a ticket for 30 minutes (I was after a 2 hour ticket for £2)! It' stressful enough having the visit the hospital without having this hassle on every visit. Come on Medway, if you're charging for parking then at least make it as easy to pay as possible!",0
116959," I came in on Monday 14th October 2013 to have some spinal surgery .The Op went well, and to quote the consultant everything is now ‘Tigity-boo', and I can honestly say, my back hasn't felt better for years. The level of care and dare I say it, ‘customer service', I received from all the staff associated with D5, the surgical team and the consultant, in my opinion, couldn't have been any better. All questions were answered straight away and in plain English, all staff were polite, friendly and good humored, and as an added bonus, a regular supply of tea was available…….always great for patient morale! What I will also mention, was the quality of the food…… I was highly impressed. Ok, it's never going to be at 5* Michelin level, however, all that I had was hot, tasty, filling and nutritious, exactly what's needed to start the healing process. Many thanks indeed to all involved.",0
116986, The doctor and her team yet again were excellent. From reception through to the doctor herself the care was exceptional. All staff constantly checked I was comfortable and explained everything to me in simple terms. I was made to feel very comfortable and (for choice of a better word) important. A wonderful team of people who really need praise and recognition for their commitment and attitude. I really can't thank them enough. This could be extended to all units and staff members at St Helier. Invest don't cut services. Many thanks,0
117798," Hi, just one observation, there is a rather user un-friendly car park system. for your consideration 1) the keyboard is low and unreadable at night. I saw many people kneeling on the ground struggling to use it. Suggest raising up to a useable level. 2) on two occasions the system just displayed ""Not in Use"". 3) the lighting above one of the machine was broken for several days and people advised me in gest to bring a torch. 4) If you over run the time by 5 minutes, you have to buy another half an hour. 5) there are no canopies over the ticket machines, so at night in the rain they are very very difficult to use. 6) perhaps consider renewing the system and using one of the normal ticket with barrier systems. best regards",0
118595," Booked for urgent (GP referral) upper GI tract endoscopy. Visited this unit 2005 for colonoscopy good experience on that occassion. This visit (with some anxiety) gastroscopy is not a procedure anyone looks forward to. Great experience all staff excellent from reception to booking in Nurse and doctor - caring sensitive and wonderful sense of humour. Great team spirit. I was listened to (complex medical history) and challenging problems due to previous treatment. I never felt rushed just supported to make the best chioces for my situation and excellently cared for at all times. Senior reg, professional but friendly and assisting nursing staff top class in all respects. Nothing was too much trouble, recovery staff excellent and results given sensitively and properly. This department maintains consistently high standards, it really shows. The fabric of the place is a little worn in places but the place is clean and most importantly the patients receive consistent high quality friendly care. I worked in the NHS for 20 years (ex SRN), it is so gratifying to see a department well run and totally patient focussed. Well done, many thanks.",0

118952, Would not subject my worst enemy to the care of this hospital. Neglected and uncared for does not even begin to describe how I felt while seriously ill. Adequate medication was not supplied and staff failed to notice that I hadn't been able to eat for a full 3 days while there. And considering I was already underweight this could have been fatal. Certain staff were quite frankly unacceptably rude and other patients where left to suffer. I found myself havingto help elderly patients (despite my own condition) because the night staff felt it was acceptable to leave an old lady lying on the floor in pain for more than half an hour. And thenhad the cheek to yell at me.for helping the poor woman. Rude and uncaring staff that should not be looking after vulnerable people,1

130988,My brother died age 52 on a ward of a heart attack a week after kidney cancer treatment. I was not informed for 19 days that he had died. I didn't know he was in hospital as he didn't want to worry me after dad was ill treated in Colchester Hospital in 2001. Dad had terrible bed sores and wasn't fed or given fluids and I sat at his bedside nearly all day and watched the staff ignore him at meal times. His mouth was so dry I thought his lips were peeling. I never took all my complaints further as the staff just talked their way out of it all. Tried complaining through PALS and found them to be very unhelpful and covering matters up.,1

I understand that this centre may be taken over by GP's - I trust that we see no change in the service provided & we retain the current staff. I noticed that some people who are not registered with a GP use it as their GP service.

120811," My elderly mother had the misfortune to be in Pinderfields last year. Her experience was distressing; she was overlooked by staff on many occasions, being promised basic needs which were not met. She was on a drip, which was left empty, even though staff told her on a number of occasions that this would be replaced. She was told different things by each doctor, leaving her confused, upset and worried. Regrettably, my mother is again in Pinderfields. Things have certainly not improved. She is aged 80, suffering heavy blood loss in her motions and, yet again, she is not receiving any consistency of care. She has been told by one doctor she will be discharged, even though her symptoms are unchanged. Only through her actually requesting staff to look at her motions is she now being told she will not after all be discharged. Yet again, they have left my mother feeling very frightened, vulnerable and alone. Pinderfields is the NHS at its worst.",1

The Reception Staff shrugged as I waited for over an hour with a gaping cut and bleeding. No stars for them. They could see I was shocked and distressed and they knew of my medical history of Hypertension and Osteoporosis. Once attended I was professionally treated by a team of wonderful and caring Doctors, Nurses, Radiographers who went beyond the call of duty to see I was medically ok before discharging me. I would like to thank them very much.",0
120795,"My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer, received wonderful medical care but as his wife, I felt alienated by the nursing staff. I spent one and a half hours travelling to see him, spent the one hour visiting time on Ward 4 attending to his personal hygiene as they left him in the same pyjamas for 4 days despite spares in his locker, and even he commented on how embarrassed he was by how he smelt. There is one rule for us and another for others due to their religion. In my opinion, this is totally unacceptable. The nurse who carried out his pre-op was unprofessional and condescending, I was physically sick when we came out. I am so grateful that his life was saved, the surgeon was fantastic but please, do not punish me because I was anxious.",0

Also the two nurses that were looking after her, were talking in a different language to one another while making her bed. Which confused her as she had just had her operation and didn't know what was going, or how to talk properly. Then when her clinical bags that held her urine, had come undone by mistake, the two nurses made her sit in a corner in a chair for two hours. When she was wet through.

157596,"My Mum, who suffers with Parkinsons had an issue ( we have since found out was to do with her medication) where she had become delusional and started seeing things that were not there. She thought people were trying to kill her. She spent the most dredful month in Hull Royal Infirmary. For the first week she was told she was dehydrated (she was not). She was visited by a few doctors none of them diagnosed this as a side affect of her parkinsons medication. Not only that since reading on the interenet this is regarded as fairly common with this parkinsons medication. My mum was left in a room on her own like a prison cell no one to talk to apart from the visions in her head. This started to make my mum worse. But after 4 weeks we were told my mum had improved and was discharged. She had not improved, and this was sadly proven 2 weeks kater when she walked out of the house and went missing. Dazed and confued she was found by a search and rescue helicopter a mile from home stuck in a woodland in the middle of a bramble bush cut to shreds. There were over 100 people actively involved in the search for my mum costing tens of thousands of pound, just so the hospital could save a few hundred. She was stuck there for at least 4 hours. The hospital has caused my family a lot of distress the staff do not have a clue how deal with some issues. Since this incident my mum was taken to a mental health unit at castle hill. There she was quickly diagnosed, the medication which was causing the problem was reduced and a new medication started. This should have been done at Hull Royal or if they could not solve the problem she should have been moved to the unit at castle hill, she should not have been sent home. If my mum had not been found she could have died. Hull Royal is a disgrace.",1
121439," A few month ago I was in the early stages of having investigations done for a suspected heart problem. One day I was having very severe attacks where my heart raced up to 200 beats per minute, I couldn't breath, violently trembling, blacking out, vomiting, severe pain in chest and head. I called an ambulance and they took me to Wythenshawe hospital. The paramedics managed to capture one of my attacks on their ecg machine and they printed it out to give to the doctors and nurses in A&E. When I got to the hospital the paramedics wheeled me to a curtained room and left me there. I lay on the bed having attack after attack after attack for 45 minutes. I was left on my own completely. Not a single doctor or nurse came to see me, I was not hooked up to any machines and my husband was forced to sit and wait in the waiting area so even he was not around to look after me or support me emotionally. When eventually I was seen the attacks had stopped on there own. A male doctor looked at me like I was a hypochondriac looking for attention because my attacks had stopped by that point and he could not believe that someone of 26 and looked relatively healthy could have a heart problem. He wanted to send me home there and then despite me trying to explain that I am having investigations on my heart. My husband told him to look at the ecg print out that the paramedics had given them. We were then told that they had lost it! If it wasn't for a lovely lady doctor who had actually listened to what I was describing, I would have got sent home. She insisted I stay in at least until they got my blood results back. When they did come back they found a high level of cardiac enzymes in my blood stream which proved my heart had experienced a severe trauma. I was then kept in overnight in the coronary ward. I just want to clarify that the care I received on the coronary ward was much different. They were very attentive and took good care of me. They restored my faith in Wythenshawe hospital. Many months later I have learnt what is wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with a chronic illness called Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). It is a neurological disorder where my autonomic nervous system (the part of my brain that controls my heart and other organs) is faulty. Since then when I have severe attacks like I experienced on this day I have chosen not to go back to Wythenshawe because of the poor care I received in A&E. I can accept them not knowing what was wrong with me as my condition is very complex and hard to diagnose but I cannot accept them losing my ecg, leaving me alone for 45 minutes while experiencing what I thought were heart attacks, and I can not accept the male doctor not listening to me and just dismissing me because I'm young. Sometimes the young have health problems too!",1

121536,This story has been posted by Healthwatch Tameside on behalf of a member of the public who asked not to have their name published. They said… Lady had classic signs of gallstones but was diagnosed as having bowel cancer (after no scan or investigation) by a consultant at Tameside Hospital. Diagnosis then changed to constipation. Several other doctors believed she had gallstones but did not want to challenge the diagnosis. She was left in severe pain for some time until at last getting a correct diagnosis and surgery. One of the unnecessary and distressing procedures ordered by the consultant was a colonoscopy. The sedation she was assured she would be given was not given and after 10 minutes of agonising discomfort she was screaming in pain and begged the nurse to stop the procedure. She had to undergo another colonoscopy a month later and in the meantime suffered post traumatic stress. The procedure was later found to have been unnecessary as she had gallstones. Her husband was advised to contact PALS but feels it would be a waste of time.,1

She was complaining of extreme weight loss and rectal bleeding. From September 2012 until January 2013, she was told it was 'all in her head' and was given a psychiatric appointment. Eventually she was referred to Tameside Hospital for a blood transfusion. Not given colonoscopy for another 3 months in spite of copious rectal blood loss. Now has colostomy and is on chemotherapy to reduce the tumours but is terminally ill with secondary liver cancer.

When I asked somebody why this was the case, they just said ""we know he doesn't seem to be getting better"". My Dad has already contracted pneumonia after the first stay and ended up being readmitted, discharged too early and back in again two days later. This time is even worse, as my already weak Father who has serious heart problems and pneumonia is left to suffer in a ward full of norovirus patients. There is no evidence of isolation of the symptomatic patients and we are all shocked at this. There is no evidence of any infection control measures being taken. My Stepmother rang my Father this morning and he says he feels ""wretched"", all this to a backdrop of someone vomiting violently. It's like hell in there and my Father is now so low in mood and has lost all hope of recovering it's heartbreaking. I have a clinical job in a busy city centre hospital and understand how difficult conditions can be at this time of the year. To be fair, the nursing staff have been kind, but that does not excuse what I have seen in this hospital over the past several weeks. This whole experience has caused upset beyond belief to my Father and to his family.

122473," My 11yr old daughter began experiencing stomach pain, with nausea and as it got worse after 5 days my daughter was admitted to children's ward. There were over 11 attempts at getting a cannular into my daughter which was exceptionally distressing and painful and left her with bruises up both arms and also across her feet (caused particular pain as she had two scars on inside of both feet after an op for accessory navicular in jan). Finally the cannular was inserted but only after the play worker with us stepped in and told the dr that she would allow no further attempts to take place as they were basically torturing her! We were discharged the following day, despite my daughter still being in pain and feeling sick, with the dr saying she was constipated? My daughter had opened her bowels twice at hospital with no issue and even when I asked if they needed a sample was told no. Three days later our gp sent us back as my daughter was doubled up in pain unable to eat and could barely hold fluid down. We went back to the kids ward and waited over 2hrs for anyone to see us, when the consultant arrived she fleetingly looked at my girl told the nurse to give her paracetamol and water and see her the next day! My daughter was crying in agony so I discharged her and drove to York a+e, where she was given morphine for pain and admitted to a ward. After demanding an MRI at York it has disclosed inflamation of the terminal illieum, her lymph nodes are very swollen and inflamed and the bacteria helicobacter pylori has been found in the wrong part of her bowel that it should not be in. The continual failure of the NHS at both Hull and York hospital have left my daughter suffering for nearly 4 weeks now, if my daughter and I had been listened to in the first place this diagnosis should have been found much earlier! We are now waiting for an urgent endoscopy and colonoscopy to be done to determine which bowel disease is responsible to enable treatment to start as York hospital are unable to conduct child endoscope tests. We have waited four days now (2 were wk end) and my daughter is in agony unable to eat without crippling pain or being sick, the same with fluids!

I left my mobile phone contact number at TRAQS for the best way to contact me and was assured I would be called on that number. I was contacted on my landline and fortuitously I was in the house. They did not have the mobile number! ! 4. I received the letter with the details of RHS entrance, consultant and clinic the day after my referral - that was poor. Not sure whether above letter is from TRAQS - possibly the NHS?",0
123487," Great experience at Pinderfields when me and my partner went for our 20 week anatomy scan at the Obstetrics department. The hospital itself looks fantastic after being completely rebuilt from the ground up. The main entrance is a big open space with a large food hall and waiting area (with a airport style 'gate' system for finding the right part of the hospital to go to). We were seen within 5 minutes of our appointment time. The nurse doing the scan did a great job of explaining what she was doing and giving us all the information we needed. The only drawbacks to the visit is the lack of public WiFi in the hospital, and having to pay £5 for a print out of the scan itself (surely they could just email it to you for free?) Other than that we were both really impressed, and will more than likely use Pinderfields again when our little fella is due!",0
123691," My 74yr old father had lung cancer last year, had part of his lung removed at Guys. In June of this year he started to get severe pains in his back, lose his peripheral vision and severe headaches, had loss of some of his hearing that was all slowly getting worse, so was referred to Opthalmology, who sent him for MRI's on his head, he marked an appointment for him to see a Neurologist as urgent, kept phoning about appointment but was always told it is in the pipeline! A week ago he started to have falls, 3 in 3 days, so we called an ambulance after last fall as he could not move his left leg, was told he may of had a stroke so they took him into A & E,( still no urgent appointment for Neurologist received and had been waiting 7 weeks ) We were told after another MRI that it was not a stroke, but he had, had 2 large bleeds on his brain, but what was more devastating was that my mother, father and myself ( his daughter) were told in a busy A&E Department that he had secondary cancer probably from his lung again, that had spread to his Brain and that it was terminal! We were in the A&E Department for 15 hours, my dad on an uncomfortable trolley, waiting for a bed in a suitable ward, they finally found him a bed on a Dementia ward! My son sat with his granddad all night because my father was very agitated about being told the news then put onto a Dementia ward. The next day we bought my dad home as he was so upset..... We as a family feel total outrage that he waited and waited for so long to get an ""urgent"" Neurology appointment. We feel let down so badly it is utterly disgraceful to treat people this way, totally inhumane.",1

124078, My daughter has been on the Disney ward 3 days firstly I can say the nurses was amazing. The doctors how ever was disgusting my daughter was suffering abdominal pain and reffered to surgeons who took blood and said her platelets was low but they could release her to the pediatricians. The pediatricians told us 3 different stories about her blood one minit they said they was fine the next they wasn't and then they was again. She was put on nil by mouth for 9 hours after the surgeons refered her bback. The pediatricians refused to look at her and we waited 2 days for a guesse on why she was in pain. She was then told it could be any of 4 reasons and released her still in agony. I am disgusted how the doctors do not talk to each other the communication was horrific and my daughter is still poorly. I will never let my daughter come to this hospital again.,1

124541,I too received a £100 Parking Charge Notice (PCN) even though I was parked in a disabled bay displaying my blue badge. According to the PCN the act of parking in the RFH car park means that I agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions set out in the signage along with other terms and conditions (not specified) of the RFH car park. Which in effect means regardless of whether you see/read the signs you automatically enter into a contract with the appointed managing company Parking Eye Limited. At no time was I notified by the RFH that disabled patients were required from November 2013 to register their blue badges at reception or the security room by A&E. It is apparent that RFH managers priority is to supplement reduced government funding by hitting the most vulnerable patients. If any other blue badge patients have been affected they are welcome to contact me assuming Patient Opinion allows me to show this email address.,0

Shocking experience, have to leave a message on machine for call back to make an appointment - 10 weeks to get an appointment which then took another 2 weeks to get results back which was inconclusive as the analysis was not done on the sample within the required time of 60 mins but instead was tested 6 hours later!

I am a nurse myself and find this appalling. His medication was ordered on the Monday but still had not arrived on the Friday so had to take some in from home. He was discharged with NO pain medication or a dressing to his leg its a pity I cant put a photograph of his leg on here as everyone who has seen it cannot believe he was sent home like this.

125449, My grandmother was admitted to the hospital for rest from originally being at blackburn hospital before she was due to be sent home. Unfortunately my grandmother suffered a heart attack while at burnley hospital and died. she was looked after a doctor who did not care about her and when it came time to confirm the cause of death the doctor flatly denied to sign of a cause of death even though she had just had a heart attack and the doctors prior to her dying had confirmed that she suffered a heart attack. My grandmother was not signed off so i could not bury her that day which caused imme nse stress and suffering to my family without the coroner getting involved who wanted a post mortem done on the body even though the cause of death was obvious. Once she had passed away we were told that the body would be taken down to the mortuary and that a funeral directors had been called to move the body as they had been having problems with their porters. Instead the body was put in a van and taken to blackburn hospital where i was told a post mortem would have to be done and then i could pick the body up from blackburn. Instead i paid £700 plus for an mri scan to be done to respect my grandmothers wishes which confirmed that my grandmother had died of a heart attack. I was not treated with respect and the doctors are just concerned with looking after themselves let alone any patients. My grandmother contracted viruses while at the hospital and the hospital had no respect for her and when she did pass away it took the doctors a further hour to confirm that she had passed away and only then did they take the catheter off after a further fifteen minutes.,1
125680," Staff didn't work well together and gave conflicting and contradictory advice regarding feeding my newborn. Some of the staff (not midwives) were disrespectful and discourteous towards my wife. She was so upset she insisted I take her home although staff wanted her to stay another night. It would have been nice had the staff given my wife encouragement and praise not made her feel like an awful useless terrible mother. It would have given her confidence instead she was demoralised and felt like a terrible let down, not what any woman needs after giving birth. I hope staff don't treat anyone else's wife in this appauling manner.",0

Repeated logistal failures have meant that a year after being referred to Hillingdon hospital as a query cancer he has yet to receive a definitive diagnosis or appropriate treatment.. He has been discharged allowing, i believe, the hospital to remove him from the cancer waiting times when all that has happened is that transport failed to arrive to collect him.

127074,"NHS Direct called an ambulance on behalf of our 12 month old son who had difficulty breathing in the early hours on Christmas day. The paediatrician made it clear he was unhappy the Paramedic administered a nebuliser whilst on route to the Hospital citing that it would not help. The paediatrician did some cursory checks (excluding family history) and concluded it was Bronchiolitis and that nothing could be done, he further advised that any home remedies such as vapour rub or steam would not help either. I was distressed for my son's well being but got no consolation was offered and my son was discharged. It was clear to both my husband and myself that his health was further declining throughout the day so we felt it necessary to take our son to the Children's A&E Hospital, within just a few minutes of our arrival the doctor administered oxygen. Shortly afterwards he was given a nebuliser with Salbutamol with a steroid and his situation improved rapidly. However the attending paediatrician felt it necessary to admit him for further treatment of hourly nebulisers and additional steroids. I am very grateful, and glad to say that whilst he has not yet made a full recovery the medication provided by the paediatrician at the Children's A&E has definitely made him less distressed. In closing I am fraught with worry that had we resigned to the advice of the paediatrician at the Heartlands Hospital my son could have died.",1

I was offered a digital hearing aid (for one ear) some 7 years ago but had not used it all the time - my hearing in the interim had worsened slightly and I was offered a re-test recently. The audiologist was very thorough and explained the hearing tests and results in detail. I was offered two new hearing aids - the latest model! I couldn't fault the help, advice and service this department provides and will make sure the new aids are put to good use. Having been treated in several other NNUH departments over the years, I have found this hospital to be a superb facility for Norfolk residents.",0

131854,My son is four and recently had a tonsillectomy on ward 11. As an overnight case was horrified when we were expected to carry /drag him and his bags a fifteen minute walk and up two floors in a busy lift to find an overnight bed for him on another ward this was at 19.00hrs. Prior to this the theatre team and anaesthetic team were professional whilst also being very friendly and reassuring. His daytime care back on the ward was minimal we had to beg for painkillers for him 8 hours after he last had any. There was no warm smile or engagement of conversation with him felt like we were a burden on the staff. Syringes were thrust at us to adminster my sons meds he was deprived of half his prescribed painkillers and was in constant agony. He had many frowns and scowls from a staff who should not work in a care enviroment if they have no compassion. Night nurse was brilliant and they should have more staff like her. Relieved when we trecked back to the ward the next day to be discharged. Have been able to persuade my son to eat with threats of a return to Ward 11.,1
131829,"I recently accompanied a relative who was suffering with stress related condition resulting in him being extremely agitated, confused and delusional. He was clearly suffering with a mental condition that required urgent treatment. Although the staff in the A&E Clinical Diagnostic Unit (CDU) ward were very helpful and caring, he was asked to wait for assessment in bed that was surrounded by people with physical injury. One patient in the CDU was vomiting and another was crying out in pain. Placement of mental patients along with those suffering from physical injury is completely inappropriate and dangerous (for both types of patients). People with mental problems need to wait in a safe, calm and low stress environment. In the case of my relative, he found the CDU ward was too stressful and he spent his time pacing up and down the corridor outside the ward. We had arrived at Worthing A&E at 05:00 in the morning and he had to wait until 07:00 in the evening before he was admitted to a psychiatric ward in another hospital. In my view it is appalling that we are placing mentally ill people in beds next to people with physical injury. Mental illness should be given better resources, higher priority and treated more sensitively.",1

132378,"Colchester Hospital - the ward sister promised to seek specialist help for my mother, traumatised in a horrendous accident, but 'forgot' to and insultingly said a week later 'How can I make it up to you?

In my opinion this is a shocking repeat of the terrible care my father received four years ago, when Colchester Hospital misdiagnosed him, left him shivering through the night, almost didn't allow him to eat all weekend...we kept a bedside vigil and saw things that would make you weep, poor standards and a total lack of care - hours spent gossiping around the nurses' station.",1

We were told that my mother could not stay in hospital and she had to go home. My mother needed 24 hour care at this point she could barely see and she was in pain and confused. She then contracted a water infection and was given penicillin which she is allergic to and was told this when she was admitted. It was only after about 4 days she had a red wrist band put on after been given the penicillin. She had another seizure and never really recovered.

I understand the hospital is always short of beds but it looks like once you've reached the stage that nothing more can be done for you they want your bed and will boot you out whatever your age or time of night.

A urine test was done, blood pressure taken and heart monitored - lots of toing and froing and leaving us to just watch our son rapidly deteriorate. We were informed he just had a bad headache and take him home. My son was promptly sick once we got home so back to the hospital and after much arguing with the front desk we insisted on being seen immediately as by this time my son was almost unconscious through pain. Finally got to see a new doctor who had just come on duty and therefore needed to be refreshed with the details - the notes had been mislaid - on hearing symptoms the new doctor immediately sent my son for a scan which came back showing a brain tumour which was causing hydrocephalus which was causing the pain. He was finally given morphine and anti inflamatory steroids and we waited and hour and a half for an ambulance to take us to St George's Hospital in Tooting for emergency treatment in the Neurology department where we were told that he was in a life threatening situation and if we hadn't put our foot down he could have died. St George's have since treated my son with an emergency shunt to release the fluid that was building up in his brain due to the tumour blocking the natural drainage channel and had a follow up operation a couple of months afterwards to remove the whole tumour which thankfully was benign but the size of a grape. Apparently our son did not tick all the boxes that were required for him to have been given a scan even though it was obvious that there was something seriously wrong going on - surely at some point knowledge should have overtaken procedure by rote. The ambulance staff told us that if our son had gone into the hospital drunk with a head injury he would have automatically received a catscan. As our son hadn't been sick on arriving at the hospital on the first occasion he wasn't taken seriously enough to have been given the scan which would have shown immediately that there was a tumour in his brain - it was so clear that I could see it when I looked at the xray. I am astonished that my son could have died or gone into a permanent coma which we were reliably informed would have happened had he not received the anti-inflamatory steroids. The doctor who referred my son from the Pru to St George's was extremely efficient but the first two we saw didn't really seem to have a clue what was going on or what to do apart from take my son's blood pressure and pulse and took no notice of our concerns over his confusion. I can only thank the staff at St George's who cared for my son superbly.",1
134257,"While in Scarborough hospital, Coronary Care Uni after a heart attack, I was woken at 11pm and moved into a side ward, then moved at 4am back onto the CCU ward, then was put into a storage room because i wasn't happy that a dead woman was in the bed next to me, i was told i was selfish by the ward sister, i then was subjected to watching a old man die, which i have never seen before in my life, i am 55, female. They refused to close the curtain around myself and the dying man, who was directly across from myself, i am now considering my options on the treatment on this hospital!",0
134596,Gp referred my little boy to see about his foot turning inwards after a year of telling me I was wrong and now been waiting months to be seen and still no sign of appointment :( He had straight legs now they are bowing and he has more falls and bruises its appalling leaving kids so long. Longer goes on more complications are going to arise I just hope my child does not end up disabled as it would have been easily preventable with early treatment..he has lost two centimetres in height due to the bowing already.,1
134421,"Our son suffers with Asperger's Syndrome and has depression. He visited the A&E with his father after a self harming incident. He was initially cleaned up and left in the waiting room for over five hours. His blood pressure and temperature was not taken or was he reviewed to his distress levels. Thankfully, his father has a calming influence and was able to reassure him but I feel so angry that he had to wait for over five hours before treatment. Isn't there a procedure whereby when a person comes into A&E with mental health problems that the crisis team is alerted? When he eventually saw the doctor it was only then was my son asked if he wanted to see the crisis team. He was treated very well by the doctor and nurse but this doesn't stop the concern that we feel towards his initial treatment. Naturally, our son made a decision to leave the A&E and come home simply because he was so exhausted and distressed over his experience. People who have mental health problems or multiple disabilities deserve better treatment. As a family we feel disappointed and reluctant to give a higher rating we hope that situations like ours doesn't happen to other families.",1
134568,Had xray done on my jaw to see what teeth were infected & the hospital dentist refused to drain the abscess from my face claiming it was inflammation & told me that if I don't take the antibiotics the infection could get worse & be life threatening. what a horrible thing to say I already explained that I suffer with panic attacks & was wary taking the antibiotics in case of side affects & said I was taking salt water & the dentist says that? Anyway useless doctor & I went home in a dazed state feeling frightened that I was going to die. I haven't been able to eat or sleep properly since.,0

The young man on reception was continually using the computer terminal to access his facebook page on the internet. This occurred over a 20 minute period. I would be interested to know the hospitals procedures concerning staff access to the internet. This is not the first time I have seen hospital staff on the internet. I have seen it at A& E and also the eye clinic reception.",0
134825,"The doctor glanced over my two year olds xrays for a matter of seconds and decided she was fine, he had no alternative diagnosis for why she was unable to bear weight on her leg without sobbing and no intention of finding out. He offered to strap the leg anyway (though he did not know why) then was told not to by the rude and ill tempered nurse who gave us no explanation but just walked away, leaving my husband and I alone with our daughter not knowing if we had been dismissed and no better informed than we had been when we arrived 2 hour earlier. The only positive experience was the nice lady who took the xrays who was both patient and polite.",1
135095,"My brother was admitted to darenth valley hospital and has been in a number of wards. When brought in by ambulance he was seen quickly, however the nurses in the A & E resus unit on Saturday night were more interested in chatting amongst themselves and discussing their break times and when changing his oxygen didn't even speak to him to say what she was doing. In fact treating him like an object and not a person.. Then when he was taken for an x ray he was left totally alone in the corridor outside the x ray dept. he was feeling sick and had I not gone to look for him and quickly give him a plastic bag would have vomited over himself. I will say the treatment by the doctors there was good. Again , in cdu, the nurses showed just how uncaring they are. Ignoring him when he was in pain and having trouble breathing, and not even assisting him to wash, he was still in the same gown on Sunday evening that he had been admitted in.. I will give credit where it is due and say that the treatment he received when he was in Rowan ward in November was very good , the nurses there were very attentive and caring. If only all nurses were like those.",1
135414,"As a regular inpatient due to a variety of issues although the cleanliness and standards of care sometimes need attention the food however is constistantly excellent. The cafeteria is always clean, staff friendly and meals well cooked and of a high standard. The same level of food is delivered to the wards and a particular favorite of.mine is the cheese and onion pie - well worth a try if you are there on a Thursday. Considering the bad press given regarding hospital food this hospital does extremely well delivering hwalthy nutritious tasty and well made food for all patients and this I feel is a big part of getting patients well again",0
150210,I am really unhappy with the the charges made for the maternity scan photos. I do not think that £10.00 for one photo is justifiable. Having spoken with many other pregnant women using other hospitals this isn't comparable. One lady who is having her baby is Sheffield is paying £3.00 for one photo. Whereas here we are being charged £10.00 for one! In your response to the other ladies review in January you failed to delete part of your response! I have copied this below and as you can see my your own admission you've said that Warwick charge £10.00 for three copies. Therefore this doesn't compare favorably. I am having my scan in Rugby - however the charge is still the same. I don't have any issues with the service when I had my son in January 2012 I couldn't have asked for better and hopefully this will be the same this time. However I would kindly request that you review the charges that are currently being made. he costs cover the paper and other expenses and compares favourably with other Trusts that offer the service in Warwickshire (Warwick for example charge £10 for three copies – how much do we charge? I can remove this bit if need be).,0

136153,"My nan was admitted to Heamotology ward via A&E and after 2 weeks was diagnosed with multiple myalnoma. She stayed in hospital a further 2 weeks due to sever groin pain and to start her chemo treatment. When I visited my nan she explained the nurse had not given her regular medication when I asked the nurse she said it happened when other nurse was on duty. I was then there another time when a nurse was getting my nan her analgesia and I noticed she was going to give codeine when I explained she not perscribed that she has paracetamol. Nurse said o my mistake?! On 22/12/13 my nan informed me she was being discharged the next day i approached a nurse to ask for plan of care her reply... U nan said she is going home so guess she is?! I explained about my Nans ankles being swollen and asked was she on any diuretics? Her answer she just needs to spend more time in bed?! I then said my Nans breathing seemed a little off compared to her normal she ignored me and carried on the computer. My nan was discharged on 24/12/13 with an extremely complicated medication regime in which no staff had gone through with her or my dad and no information was given. As I am a newly qualified nurse myself I was lucky to sort medication out only because I opened the letter addressed to her GP. I was so disgusted to find out my dad had asked for the medication to be in blister packs for the hospital to say they don't do them?? My nan was admitted to a hospital in liverpool on 26/12/13 with pneumonia and died 31/12/13! If that nurse had listened to me about the breathing she might still be here now!,,,",1
136224,"Since the introduction of the new camera-recognition system I am constantly appalled by the method one has to use to check out. The keypad on the machines is almost impossible to read for anyone with other than perfect eyesight. The keypad is too low down, everyone has to crouch down to use it. OK for wheelchair users (would they be using it anyway) but not for the rest of us. The system does not tell you what you owe, you have to calculate it having had to remember the time you checked in. Make an error and you risk a fine. Administrators should go to the Octagon Centre Carpark to see how simple a similar system can be; easy to use machines; machine tells you what you owe; pay and go.",0
136364,"My mother was taken into A&E, via ambulance, today 3rd February, 2014. My mother was shaking, unable to talk, had right side weakness. The ambulance woman asked if my mother had seizures in the past. I confirmed that she had but had not had a fit for approximately 8 years and had not bern on any medication for fits for many,many years.I explained my mother has had several strokes and TIA's. When settled into a cubical the paramedic told the senior nurse about my mother's condition and her allergies (phenabarbitone and fenatode, both anti epilepsy drugs. Both have caused my mother to be admitted to Intensive care at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham). The senior nurse then, as way of introduction, said the hospital was closed due to an out break of norovirus and I would not be able to visit my mother when she was admitted. Not the best of starts. The male nurse came and did bloods, etc, and on the whole very good. It was the Doctor who was truly awful. She walked in, didn't introduce herself (lucky she had ""doctor"" written on her top) and said "" your mother has had a seizure, I'm going to give get fenatode"". I was stunned, this before she had even examined her and obviously read the notes, from the paramedics, of my mother severe reactions to phenabarbitone and fenatode. I told her she would not be giving my mother any anti epileptic drugs. She snapped at me and said she would. I told her this was not a fit but a stroke, she just wouldn't listen, stubbenly fixated on a seziure. I tried to explain why I knew it to be a fit (I'm my mother's full time carer). Mouth droop and right sided weakness, unable to talk was not a complaint my mother has had after a fit but always happened after a stroke. After my father stepped in, she conceded she had got it wrong and she now agreed it was a stroke. Truly unbelievable and scary to think she could have seriously endangered my mother by giving her a drug that had sent her to intensive care in the past. My heart sank when I was told that stroke victims now have to go to Worcester hospital instead of the Alexadria, Redditch. This lady doctor was rude ( and yes, I admit I told her I found her patronising and she wasn't listening to us, her family. Respect cuts both ways, hospital staff must be spoken to without abuse, etc, but so do patience and their relatives). If I hadn't put my foot down with this doctor, god only knows what condition my mother would be in now. Thank goodness my mother made a fair enough recovery to be able to take her home. I would have hated to have left her in this hospital. Our first, and hopefully our last visit to Worcester Hospital.",1

150263,"My poor father has just died in the Princess Royal and it was catching MRSA on the Ardingly Ward in December which greatly contributed to his final demise. Without having caught this he would be with us now. He had other problems already and just was too frail to deal with the after effects of this hideous infection. It knocked him for six and this was aggravated by C Difficil which is a debilitating side effect of the antibiotics used to treat the MRSA. He also had urinary tract infections. We as a family have been through hell and now our grief is being aggravated by the fact that the powers to be at the Princess Royal are unwilling to make mention of the MRSA on his final medical certificate/death certificate. WHY??? I can't believe you have had only one case of MRSA in three months. You are just covering things up so your official stats look more presentable. Whilst my beloved father was on Ardingly Ward we expressed concern about MRSA when we saw he had a bed sore on one of his heels but our concerns were dismissed and this is the site where the MRSA entered his system. He was discharged to the Ernest Kleinwort Centre (his reason for coming into hospital was a fractured pelvis) and was just about to start mobility therapy there when the MRSA made its appearance. Even before the therapy we could see he was making great strides in being able to get about. From then on it was gradually downhill all the way. One of the staff at Kleinwort told my mother my father had a ""little infection"". Little infection!!! My mother replied by saying ""He's got MRSA hasn't he""? to which the member of staff replied yes. When I first got the news that my father was passing away at the weekend I arrived at the hospital - then I broke down in the car park and shouted ""Bloody hospital. You have killed him"". How many others have died unnecessarily?",1

150306,"This hospital greeted me with a rude receptionist at Accident and Emergency. I was in tears after her scathing rude cold and aggressive manner. The first nurse was lovely and sympathetic. I quickly learnt its a teaching hospital which could be why I was poked and prodded by many junior doctors. I was operated on that night, all was fine, until I woke up. The nurse in recovery gave me wrong information about my operation which left me confused. i was then left with no obs being taken for more than five hours, I had no pain killers administered and had to argue with nurses and doctors for some pain relieft as soon as I said I was not happy they promptly moved me to another ward which was reminiscient of Euston station with lots of male visitors to other patients all staring at me, making it difficult and embarrassing to get up and go to the toilet with an open at the back gown. I was given no food, no water, yet other paitents were lavished with attention from nurses. I was discharged with little intervention in my wounds despite me saying I had a painful hard lump.... two days out of hospital the lump they didnt bother to investigate turned out to be a bad abcess and I had to go to another hospital to have another operation,, this was Milton Keynes General Hospital who were wonderful, fed me, gave me drugs, gave me water, and looked after me. I was bruised beyond belief from the Stoke Mandeville, both my hands overly bruised and swollen I am not old, and no one could give me any reason why I sustained so much bruising, This hospitals nursing care was disgusting, there was so many other things that they did, but I cannot go into it,,,, shocking,, dont go there....",1

Leighton have confirmed my Aunt has Alzheimers Shortly after her admittance I was informed my Aunt would be looked after full-time by a named carer, I said this carer was not suitable as there had been an altercation between them in the past resolved when neighbours stepped in, my Aunt had received some bruising. This 'carer' has now moved into my Aunts bungalow and has told the aftercare team she plans to have it redecorated no doubt how she wants and have some alterations done. My Aunt loved her home as it was decorated, it wasn't modern but she was happy with it, the garage is full of furniture probably my Aunts. The after care team have NOT contacted any neighbours to check what happened. The 'carer' drives a mobility car and is said to be suffering from ME and is aged 75, hardly the person you would expect to be able to look after someone with very restricted mobility, arthritis, and Alzheimers again the after care team believe his is OK As soon as my Aunt is discharged she is not the responsibility of the after care team so that must be the reason my concerns are ignored.. My Aunt has been aggressive at visiting time when asked if someone had visited her and she had forgotten she would get angry and clench her fists when told she had been, she also does NOT know this carer has moved in she tells me she lives nearby, when told she was going to live with her she insisted she wasn't again anger and clench fists. I have gone round and round in circles trying to make someone take notice of a potentially violent event in the future without success including PALS everyone says try someone else .

Surgical pre-assessment was not open at this time so i have had a morning off work to do pre assessment. Then because i am going on holiday I can't have it done until June (which is fine) but i will need to do a third visit for an MRSA swab.

The care that he received there was shocking, he had no feeling in his legs so was unable to use the normal toilet. He was at one point left in his excrement until my mother-in-law arrived and cleaned him up herself. He had no treatment that we are aware of for eight days not even any oxygen when my mother-in-law pointed out that he was unable to breath properly. Since then he took a turn for the worse and was taken to the I.C.U. Unit, they still didn't know what was wrong with him! Eventually after he had been in hospital for three weeks they decided that he had cancer of the nervous system and we were told hat he wouldn't leave hospital that he would die in there. My mother-in-Law asked if he could come home and was told that he was too poorly and wouldn't survive without the help of the life support system. We are not allowed to visit outside of the prescribed visiting times and they are adamant that there not be more than two at the bed which is understandable. But they could have been a it more caring to my father-in-law who has a great fear of hospitals and we are still unable to visit outside the visiting hours even though we have been told he is going to die. The care in this hospital is inconsistent and the staff are rude especially the sister! Don't use this hospital especially if you think you are going to die",1

Eventually someone along the line decided she should have a Caesarian section – this should have happened a lot sooner. Everything was wonderful after the birth, it is dreadful that she was put through the trauma by one or two staff, the five days over which she was induced five times were very difficult. The consultant and team who carried out the Caesarian section were fantastic",1
140711,"This is a review of the catering service only. I found the food to be unacceptable and unhealthy and it must be especially detrimental for long term patients. If you are one of the first wards to be served you will get a meal that you choose from a short list. It will resemble a reheated school dinner, but be less healthy. Anyone wanting to get their '5-a-day' will have to provide their own, it is impossible to do so from the food choices offered. Luckily laxatives are given with every meal! If you are on one of the last wards to be served you will not get the meal of your choice, in fact you will be lucky to get any meals. Unless you consider (literally) a dollop of tuna mayonnaise on a plate (vegetables, potatoes, bread and fruit regularly run out) or a white bread sweetcorn sandwich sufficiently nutritious for your main meal, make sure you have visitors to bring in food. But be warned, the hospital shop has an unhealthy and uninspiring selection by the time visiting hours arrive. Perhaps a partnership with a supermarket should be considered, they seem better able to provide healthy food options all day at a reasonable cost!",0
141643,My mother was taken by ambulance to the Accident Unit after a nasty fall. She was seen by a lovely nurse called Rob who admitted her and examined her. She was then taken to minor injuries where another lovely nurse put her arm in a sling. A doctor came to check her and she was taken to X-ray as they thought she had broken her humerus. To cut a long story short she had only dislocated her arm and was put under anaesthetic while it was put back by a lovely doctor and 2 super nurses. After another X-ray to make sure the arm was back in place she was allowed home.,0
141693,"My mother was in Stepping Hill hospital for two weeks, prior to her death there on 21/02/2014. For twelve days I was given no information at all about her condition, treatment or long-term prognosis. As a consequence I had no idea she was so unwell. Only when she became very ill did they decide to contact me, asking me come to the hospital urgently as her condition had suddenly deteriorated (this in spite of the fact that on my regular afternoon visit to her she seemed in reasonably good state and no one appeared at all concerned for her health). I arrived 15 minutes later to be told she had died. The fact that they left it until she was almost dead to contact me has left me devastated. Shame on you all.",0
141647,"Very poor care IMHO, my father was in and tbh I was shocked at what I seen. He got pressure sores which were dressed once in nearly 2 weeks then left without further treatment! Left lying in bed with no encouragement whatsoever to get up and sit in a chair, kept waiting for 20 mins for a urine bottle and subsequently had an accident and was then put in incontinence pants. OK some older people maybe slow but they still human beings. I am still worried about the way my father was treated in this hospital. ",1
142041,After a heart attack and stroke my dad ended up in Torbay hospital feb 12th and after initial treatment in Intensive care transferred to Midgley ward. He contracted severe respiratory failure ended up back in ICU. His care and attention has been lacking to say the best he was ignored by ward staff and left unattended and fell twice resulting in injury. my parents live in Torquay and we live in USA communication was difficult constant calling endless waiting on the phone and complete difference of updates. He was nil by mouth and offered food then we were told he was eating he had not even manged fluids.Staff on the ward which had a serious outbreak of infection attended my dad after attending another patients and failed to clean hands or wear gloves. I would never recommend this hospital.,1
142261,My granddaughter was admitted to Darlinton Hospital to have her tonsils removed at the age of seventeen. After the operation she was discharged as the operation seemed to have been sucessful. For know apparent reason she was over the next two weeks readmitted three times with heavy throat bleeds. My granddaughter was treated in A&E was admitted to ward 11 and 31. The thoughtfulness of the people including the A&E reception ladies and security people doctors nurses was excellent. I am so gratful for all there care help and understanding as I was so upset at the state my granddaughter was in. I could not of asked for any better help and care for her. Once again many thanks .,0

142442,"My grandson was treated extremely well in A and E for what was thought to be severe croup. Once transferred to the children's ward one nurse excelled herself with kindness and professionalism whilst the doctors and consulant failed to recognise the seriousness of the situation. The doctor repeated an adrenaline nebuliser many times and continued to state that she had already given over the recommended amount. As my grandson became more and more distressed and unable to breath the doctor asked for a toy to quieten him! At this point the nurse pointed out he needed oxygen not a toy as he was going blue and his heart rate was over 200. At last the decision was made to send him to the intensive care unit in Southampton. He was rescued by an excellent team,intubated and his airway secured for the journey. This was now the day after his admission to Frimley. He remained in the Picu for only 24 hours where he received intravenous antibiotics for an as yet undiagnosed infection and as he had come round and pulled out his own airway was assumed to be better! We were then told he would go to the children's ward but half an hour later this changed and he was transferred back to Frimley by the Picu nurse. Now the real nightmare began. The consultant came round and gaily said he could go home later and come back daily for his Intravenous antibiotics. I pointed out that his heart rate was getting lower and he was drowsy and unable to talk and said that Southampton had said he would stay for at least 5 days for observation. She backed down. My grandson now continued to deteriorate, unable to swallow, eat or drink. Eventually the doctor put a drip up as he was getting dehydrated. My grandson now developed a terrible headache so the doctor prescribed I'V paracetamol. The nurse did not check his identity or follow proper procedures and once out of the room the alarm continued to go off due to air bubbles in the drip. The nurse was called back several times to rectify it. Later the doctor came to inform us that a Drug Error had been made but not to worry it wasn't fatal! Friday came and my grandson had not passed urine and his heart rate was in the 50's. The nurses and doctors were constantly asked to help. My daughter rang me distraught that the heart alarm was constantly going off as his heart rate was now in the 40' s and the nurse had turned down the alarm parameter as it was disturbing everyone. I told her to demand the consultant came immediately. My grandson was rescued back to Southampton intensive care again. He had SWINE flu, parainfluenza ,bacterial pneumonia. Frimley hadn't checked his swab results so was not treated My grandsons brother also got swine flu and probably other children on the ward as he was not barrier nursed.A consultant was rude,uncaring and delayed decision making. I am writing this as my daughter is too traumatised to think about it. I am filing a formal complaint hoping that no other family goes through this horrendous ordeal.",1
142207,"I love it here. The people are nice and friendly. We've always got different things to do, for example card making, knitting, coach trips to the coast and other places. Staff help with advice, support and anything they can. At the hospital - Guy's and St Thomas' - I don't like their food. It's always cold, not really tasty. Waiting times for operations and surgery are okay considering the amount of people that need to be seen. I've always found the hospital very clean. The bed is changed every day.",0
142197,"My husband was on the Huntsman Ward Two. The staff we met seemed uncaring leaving my husband in horrific pain for many hours and some of his medication he never received at all despite our daughters asking many times about it. The staff I encountered were dismissive of everything you asked. In my opinion it is a dreadful place and needs to be closed down it is so bad. I observed an elderly man crying in pain and nobody came to his aid. Another lady was pleading for the toilet, she was crying and did the toilet while she was waiting. Based on my experience, this place is a disgrace. ",1
142299,"The CAPD Unit at St Helier is a truly outstanding example of excellence in today's NHS. The staff are without exception, an exemplary benchmark of professionalism and provide a thoroughly helpful, friendly, attentive and informative service which has a hugely beneficial impact on patients like me who are on peritoneal dialysis. I cannot recommend the staff here highly enough and therefore I cannot give any suggestions regarding service improvement as these good people are already coming in with a full 5 star rating in my opinion. Some people might say that there is always room for improvement but I can say unequivocally that this idea does not apply to this service. The CAPD Unit is quite simply a superb service of the highest order and frankly I wouldn't want to change a thing. Just keep on doing what you are doing, it's fantastic! Many, many thanks for your help. It is so helpful and encouraging to be on the receiving end of such excellent care.",0
142423,"My poor mum was taken to Maidstone Hospital as she was extremely short of breath. The consultant having completed his examination advised that my mother had a heart problem due to having too much ""salt"" in her diet. She was given some medication and deemed suitable to be discharged a few days later (the treatment and care whilst in the hospital being limited). My mother was then given an outpatient appointment for a scan two weeks later. Having arrived at the scan and upon leaving the hospital my mum's breathing became more and more labored to the point I had to find assistance and she again was admitted to the hospital where they decided to treat her for pneumonia with antibiotics. My mum died less than three weeks after she was first admitted, in actual fact she had advanced cancer! Even to the point where she lay dying they did not even have the decency to pull the curtain round her bed. I am glad I have now moved out of the area so should I become ill any time I don't have to step foot over that threshold! Absolutely appalling treatment. Suppose they couldn't be bothered because she was 78. We have complained about her treatment or lack of but the hospital have come back with no comprehensive answers. Surprise!",1

At 10.45 they arrived on the ward to be told my uncle had died 15 minutes earlier, during the earlier phone call no urgency was made of the situation. The whole family have been left devastated with a legacy that he was alone despite having many relatives who would dearly have wanted to be with him.

My sister left in the early hours but was called back later that day to collect my father, his breathing was laboured and he was finding it very difficult to get his breath. He was made to walk the 500 metres to the hospitality lounge (he struggles to walk more than 50m) where he was left, my sister found him on his hands and knees vomiting, there wasn't a member of staff to be seen. The most alarming thing is that a venflon/cannular had been left in his arm, this wasn't discovered until my sister arrived at home. Disgusting and disgraceful way to treat a patient of any age, worse in this case for a 94 year old. You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.",1

She is 33 weeks pregnant. Whilst she was in A&E she was referred for an MRI scan - two days later she is still waiting for the scan. In her first 24 hours of admission her care consisted of admitting her to an acute medical assessment ward, 2 paracetemol and after nearly 24 hours she was given some anti embolism stockings, she was then commenced on aspirin and anti coagulant injections. Today, two days later she has been told by one doctor she needs to stay in hospital until she has a scan in case she has a stroke, another doctor has told her she can go home and have her scan in outpatients but doesn't know when that will be. Apparently the MRI unit is privately contracted and closed at the weekends.",0
157667,"After a period in Peterborough Hospital during which my Father was treated extremely well and his health improved considerably. he was moved to the John Van Geest rehabilitation unit from which time he deteriorated rapidly until his subsequent death in the unit. I think I would not describe this unit as a rehabilitation unit but a transit unit to assess a patient and get them gone as quickly as possible either home into a care home, nursing home or if too ill to transfer dead. Right from my parents entry into the hospital care system his family not informed wrong with him or the nature of the care treatment given to him until he died. No Doctor ever spoke to the family and despite many requests from the myself his eldest child as to what was wrong with him or happening to him and could a extremely concerned family speak to the Doctor I was continually fobbed off by Nursing staff even during the last few days of my fathers life. Right from the beginning of his stay at the John Van Geest we were appalled at things that were taking place on the 2nd day the family observed a cut on my Fathers face and asked him how that had happened it appears the nurse decided to wet shave him despite my Fathers protests and that his electric razor was on the bedside table ( Father never wet shaved he had sensitive skin and it made him sore) during the process she cut him with the razor and when my Father yelped and said you have hurt me she swore at him threw the razor at him and stormed off. I was appalled but my Mother begged me not to complain at the time because she was frightened that Dad would be more ill treated if I complained.At that time father was well enough to sit in a chair hold a conversation and socialise instead he was left for hours on end sat in a chair in a dull back room at the end of a corridor on his own I tried to reason with the staff that this was not good for a person who had all his faculties and would it not be better for his well being that he joined the others in the common sitting area nothing changed. Visit by visit his wellbeing and health rapidly deteriorated I kept asking to speak to the doctor I kept visiting and witnessing him getting more and more ill I kept wanting to know what was actually wrong with him.Then nutrition, fluid& medicines were withdrawn with no consultation with the family at all my children visited and were instructed under no circumstances were they to give him a drink even though he begged them for one. days on end we watched him writhe and groan in pain look at us with pleading eyes mine wanting a drink eyes sheer terror I saw in his eyes as held his hand and tried to soothe him it was immensely distressing. He was found by us lying in cold wet sheets wide open windows and cold air blowing in requests for a bed change not well received. next day death rattle writhing in agony twitching moaning. Agonising and distressing to see. A nurse said to me Hes stubborn to stongwilled to die.",1

She was moved to Ward 11b where she was treated until her discharge on 5 March. During her stay she was taken down to the (Opthalmic Department for a doctor to examine her eye. She was kept waiting in reception for 4 hours during which time no one came near her to tell her what was happening or ask if she needed a drink. When she finally saw a doctor that it teh first thing she asked for. Her discharge was a total shambles, no ambulance being available to take her home, despite our being told she was coming out at 4.00pm. No one told her anything and she was left sitting ready to go by her bed for 5 hours until I came to collect her since I had been asked to do so by the nurse in charge of the ward since no ambulance was available. When I spoke to her I realised she couldn't even walk to the wheelchair I had brought to take her to the car let alone get into her house. No one on the ward had bothered to get her up out of bed and moving so her mobility was seriously compromised. Eventually an ambulance brought her home and she was stretchered into the house. I find it difficult to understand why we were asked by the nurse in charge of the ward to come and collect her as she must have realised my mother could not move about without help from trained nurses.",1

My mother in law was admitted with gastro and found herself in a ward where nursing assistants were disposing of urine down the sink, purely wiping up spills from vomit with a tissue and there were no signs of any proper cleaning and disinfecting. With the Noro virus making it's rounds presently you would think the hospital might take cleanliness a little more seriously. I also believe it's a serious OH&S issue when urine is being tipped down a sink! Then when she was discharged the discharge notes made no mention of gastro but instead referred that she had memory problems... mmmm how is it that vomiting and diarrhea is a symptom of memory problems??",1

In the next few days Mum did improve and her rehab and discharge were planned although she remained on ward 45. 5 days after admission I was phoned at home and told that my mother had suffered a fall while attempting to get out of bed .but she had been checked over and appeared ok she was suffering from delirium and was instructed not to walk about without support. During the second week of Mum's stay I became aware that there was a staffing issue, visitors arrived and began washing, feeding their relatives and changing bedding themselves because it had not been done by mid afternoon..My mother was confused and so was not a reliable source of info but I noted that the staff were constantly distracted from finishing there tasks and constantly disappeared and there was never anyone to ask about Mum's condition. On Fri 14th several visitors were upset about the state of their relatives and one of them took photographs the senior nurse appeared and apologised to us profusely saying that they were behind with everything including the drugs round because they were so short staffed.My mothers condition gradually deteriorated over the weekend and on Sunday I arrived to find her breathless, cold and confused sat in a chair wearing only a hospital gown. By Monday my mother was confined to bed on Oxygen and a drip the mask was on her head so was not helping she was obviously very ill.

I have had a long time to reflect upon our stay there - I stayed most of the time with him as much as I could. My objective, well considered view, is that my father was treated without compassion and that the majority , ( with two exceptions ) of nurses on that Ward had personalities and attitudes unsuited to the care of a dying person and his attendant son. (me). Also, upon reflection, I consider the Consultant who dealt with us was unprofessional in that she discussed my father's prognosis by his bedside within earshot of him , and although he was ill he could still hear well. Only one doctor, the Registrar, exhibited any modicum of compassion , of the sort that I would have expected to be the norm in a supposedly caring environment.. Overall, I wish my father had never gone to Wythenshawe Hospital and that he could have died peacefully at home in his last days, with compassion, by someone who cared.

147965,"Less than 36 hours after having the left breast amputated and a reconstruction an auxiliary nurse on ward 28 told the mother of my children to get out of bed and wash herself. This was not enough and she was followed into the bathroom and berated some more with huffing and puffing by the auxiliary. This was at 8.15am. The mother of my children duly washed herself, the stretching of which caused bleeding from the breast and back injuries. the A few hours later another nurse approached and said the disagreement was the fault of the mother of my children. She was also left with just ibuprofen and paracetamol for the pain rather than anything useful. This led to the mother of my children crying her eyes out and feeling the only option was to discharge herself due to the staff attitudes. Is it not enough to suffer from breast cancer, multiple surgeries, chemo and a mastectomy without being left without post surgery care due to the rudeness and disrespect shown by the staff who are meant to be looking after her?",1

149197,"My sister was admitted today, Sat 5th April, with severe back and chest pain. When the Triarge nurse came to assess her, she was in acute pain and couldn't breath. My sister's pain and anguish obviously irritated her and she threw her sheet down and said she would return when my sister calmed down! What arrogance! My sister was extremely distressed, had difficulty getting her breath and was very frightened. She was then left for 1 1/4 hours before she returned. I would like to say, that her arrogance could have well cost my sister her life. My sister, was later, that day diagnosed with pneumonia & and a blood clot on her lung. I am still seething with anger and intend to make an official complaint.",1
149286,"Admitted to Blackburn Hospital via Ambulance with severe pain and vomiting. Ward B2 cared well particularly one Male Nurse Kept one night and discharged the following day despite feeling very unwell . A good neighbour drove 15 miles to take him home! Only 2 days later taken by Ambulance back to Blackburn. He could hardly stand and was vomiting continuously. Admitted to Ward C2 and discharged on the third day. Medication was always late(Sometimes 3 hours) due to Nurses standing about chatting about their Holidays, Social Life etc or criticising their Colleagues. Never again Blackburn!",1
149357,My mother in law presented to casualty in December 2012 with stomach pains. Was told she was constipated and told to take laxatives. After several visits to hospital and GP was finally sent for scan in June 2013 where they found ovarian cyst (had been on her file for years). After many out-patient appointments and approx 4 emergency admittances she was scheduled for operation in October but was cancelled until March 2014. Having finally got her operation she has been readmitted with exact same symptons as before and they have now said she has gall stones. She has been in hospital again for over a week with no treatment but has now contracted MRSA. She has been moved to an isolation room but when she got there it was splattered with blood and she refused to go in until it had been cleaned thoroughly. Have complained to hospital but been fobbed off at every stage! Don't use Wythenshawe Hospital unless you have no other choice!,1
149349,"My brother was sent home without any medication after seeing a heart specialist at this dire hospital. My brother passed away alone at home, and we did not know until a few days later. He had suffered heart failure. Why? Why didn`t they put him on medication? He was diagnosed with an enlarged heart muscle, which our Mother was diagnosed with 5 years ago here in Manchester... and guess what - her GP started her on tablets immediately, hence she is still with us 5 years later! My brother was only 58, our Mother was 84 when she was diagnosed and given immediate meds. My family hate this hospital, they have taken away our beloved, and we are all heartbroken.",1

He was tested done and sent back to the prison. He had a minor one but has nerve damage around his heart and tissue infection. His after care 4 days after being admitted amounted to very little. Over the last 4 months he has been given Gaviscon - of all things - and a course of antibiotics. He has been diagnosed has having a Thyroglassyl cyst which keeps bursting, a Doctor said he needed it removed ASAP, that was way back in begining of January. I feel the nurses refuse to take him seriously and when he has asked to see the doctor he seems to have been fobbed off. The treatment he has received up until now at HMP Lindholme it seems to me has been diabolical.",1

Came back 12 hours later and still in horrific pain. This time admitted to ward with infected gall bladder and spent 16 days in hospital to get infection under control. Food atrocious whilst in hospital....unfit for human consumption! Was not given anything to eat for 10 days and nothing on the menu was low fat which I was told by my consultant was all that I was allowed to eat.

149570,"After 3 weeks of pain on the side of her thorax and being told to take three diferent pain killers and muscle relaxers by her doctor..she started having spasm, but extremely aggressive ones, so much that we though she was convulsing and due to this she call an ambulance..and eventually 3 more ambulances consecutively which none showed, so after two and a half hours of waiting she was taken to the ER at his hospital by her fiancé..then she was sat in a wheel chair for 3 more hours and because she couldn't stop the spasms she keep being told by the staff members to calm down and stop it...at some point she got saw by some doctor, and was sent home!! Only with the dosis of muscle relaxers and pain killers increased by 50%...7hrs later she had to go back to the ER because the pain was still there and her spasms had worsen, it took her forever to see someone but eventually was told that it was psicological and that she needed to stop that behavior..????????..by this point she had been w this spasms for two days, unable to eat, sleep or hold her daughter for that matter, and they told her to stop it..continuously..a couple of those butchers even moked my sister..??????..luckily our great aunt is a neurologist and we send her a video of my sister and we told her about the situation and the meds she was on etc...withing a min she came up w a diagnosis, she was being intoxicated by one of the meds they had increased recently..it still took them over 20hrs to check her credentials to even take her serious..yet at some point by the third day when my sister refuse to take any more of those meds and our family backed her up the medical staff started showing respect and empathy, or it could have been fear to my family's threats of sueing them..but finally and about to be discharged again they told her to stay one more night so she could see the neurologist on site, and what was the surprise? The neurologist agree with my aunts diagnosis two days prior and was speach less about not only the high doses of the meds she was put on but also by the deathly cocktel of opiaceos she had been on by her own doctor!! Eventually and only because she refuse to take the meds she spasms reduce to a point that she was let go home. They should be ashamed that a doctor in another country diagnose their patient through a video call just by looking at her and asked her what meds she was on..three days and they couldn't figured out what was the problem and treated her so badly ""making her feel embarrassed and self conscious...don't step a foot in this hospital!! 90% of the staff reeeeealy don't care about what they are doing..",1

When I asked the reception how long we would be waiting....approx. 45 mins but went in to the doctors room in the 30 mins. The centre is newly adapted and the surroundings pleasant. I was very impressed with service all the way through and felt very assured. I think it is a great reassuring service,0

He was moved to Medical assessment unit (not a heart ward) and the following day whilst visiting i was told that he had had a mild heart attack but they were,nt worried about his heart just the chest infection he had. I wa told he would be on a short stay ward and only be in for 4/5 days and would be home by the friday!!! He was moved to ward 19, was never put on a heart ward, heart monitor or any medication at all? The following day he died from cardiac arrest!

152723,"My mother-in-law suffered a fractured femur after a fall. Her treatment in the ambulance and in A&E was excellent. She had to wait three days for surgery which probably contributed to her developing complications ( pneumonia and a pulmonary embolism) She was on the ward for nine weeks and due to poor nursing care was discharged with a deep pressure ulcer on the heel of the injured leg. During her time on the ward the staff did not talk to the family about her progress and when her doctor and social worker arranged a meeting to discuss her discharge not one of the nursing staff attended ! I found some of the staff to be indifferent to patients and their relatives,and as a former nurse I find that shocking.",1
153083,"My experience of ward D1 at Royal Blackburn hospital was like a waking nightmare. My mother was treated as if she had dementia, when there was no previous diagnosis or clinical evidence. I felt that they used dementia as an excuse for the symptoms of their own failings, like her dehydration, an untreated infection, and poor nursing. She was not given life-saving treatment, when there was overwhelming evidence, (subsequently revealed in her medical notes) that she had sepsis. Ward D1 is an MRSA isolation ward and early treatment of sepsis is essential. At that time, she was denied food and fluids on a bogus claim of dementia, when it is known sepsis changes cognitive function in not only elderly patients but patients of any age. When it became septic shock, the facts were covered up and in our view she was denied the care she needed, based on their supposed interest in her quality of life. I feel this ward really needs serious investigation as I believe that patient safety has been compromised and in my case my mother died as a result of what happened there. A formal investigation recently acknowledged that my mother had died of sepsis, almost three years after her death. Why did the form after her death say that the family were happy with her care, when it was known I had called in safeguarding? And why is septic shock or sepsis not mentioned on her death certificate, but instead an infection without clinical evidence? Why was sepsis never at any point mentioned to the family? We are in the process of establishing a patients' forum to call for a full investigation as soon as possible into standards of care at the Royal Blackburn Hospital that have been hidden and overlooked.",1

153432,MY DD10 was referred to DVH a&e following severe stomach pains initally treated as a UTI by our Gp. We didnt have too long of a wait and the registar was very kind. My DD10 was scared and anxious but he reassured her and me with his pleasant bed side manner. DD10 was admitted to Willow Ward with suspected appenditicus eventually ruled out after mri scan and ultrasounds. Had a urachal cyst which requured iv fluids. I stayed on the ward for the 5 days. Found all staff helpful and kind-ward sister bit unapproachable. Only thing that annoyed me was doctors discussing situation with her dad who i am estranged from. As her FT carer staff should respect my wishes. Ward sister insistant he had parental responsibilty as on birth cert which is not the case at all-he has no say in her medical treatment and all progress and updates should be discussed with me and not in my absence just because im having a cup of tea in the parents room. This wás stressful but ultimately they looked after us. However staff need training on dealing with broken families.,0

After an entire hour waiting I gave up. As I've read in previous reviews it seems I will have to go to the clinic to book the appointment... And wish me luck with the receptionists!

153391,"Mum had a major stroke but she was still able to decide what she wanted. a Consultant treated a pain she had in her side and in her back which they believed was acid reflux she lost two stone in weight during her stay and was in pain, I questioned the pain several times informing the doctor that she had been suffering from this pain before she had the stroke. She was given Oramorph and gaviscon which did not relieve the pain. We have been through the complaints procedure which took months and two Consutant's believed that mum did not have a medical reason for a scan. A few weeks later she died from a large Pancreatic tumour. We realise mum could not have been saved but her last few months would have been made more comfortable. What constitutes a medical reason for a scan. No one consulted the family concerning mums history of this pain even though my dad was visiting her every visiting hour 7 days a week. She went downhill very fast. The Consultant never spoke to us about her treatment even though she was in his care for two months and only made one comment when my dad questioned the fact that they wanted to put her on anti-depressants. As a layman I would have thought if your treating someone and cannot alleviate the pain you give them a scan. My daughter who lives in another area had pains in her side and she got a scan within two weeks at another hospital. Mum was diagnosed when she turned yellow. Paramedics were called and she was taken into hospital she then had to endure a 41/2 hour wait in A&E before she was seen by a doctor. Half an hour later my mum was put on a drip and given injections. My Dad went home at 9.30 and mum was still in A&E at 9.30 6 hours after she had arrived. During this period she was offered no fluid. The next morning dad found my mum had been moved to the Woodpecker Ward",1
153328,"As a family we cannot thank all the departments, resus, acute medical, physio and tilgate ward enough for their compassionate care of my 88 year old father. My mother was admitted to another local hospital 4 years ago with a similar condition and we had an horrific experience of poor, bullying care of the elderly. Naturally we were extremely apprehensive however the care from everybody without exception was exemplary at East Surrey. My father was frail and had dementia and at all times was treated with dignity and kindness, no-one harried him and we're always available should we need help. The wonderful physio team we felt were heroic in their work and we are extremely grateful for all their efforts. We were so surprised by this contrasting treatment to out expectations we felt everyone had just undergone an elderly patient enhanced care course! Many thanks my father died in peace with no pain, we are of course devasted but grateful for his final care from 27-31 March.",0
153769,My mother was admitted here with stomach cancer and spent most of her time on ward 40. Sadly my mum died with both myself and sister at her bedside. In the final week of her life she was afraid of being alone so there was always a member of the family at her bedside night and day. During this time we were treated well and my mother treated with care and dignity. Although I feel many of the staff were very caring I would particularly like to single out the staff nurse whose excellent care gave both my mum and us reassurance and confidence in an often maligned NHS,0
154398,"I brought my teenage son to the paediatric A&E department as he was very ill and had breathing problems due to asthma. The nurse that saw my son was not sympathetic or caring. She wanted to get her assessment done as quickly as possible. When she was about to give my son some medication, she didn't even ask if my son had any allergies to medication I had to tell her before she was about to give my son the medicine. She did not even ask if my son had any health issues or if he had any medicine during the day. When I kindly asked her if someone can check my son, as I was a little concerned about his breathing, I was told that the doctor would call us in 5 minutes, which turned into 2 hours in which my son's breathing got worse and he was brought into their resuscitation room. Like any parent, whenever your child is in their resuscitation room you would be concerned and scared, and I was scared. My son got admitted to the ward, and the nurses on the ward were fantastic. I'm just very disappointed in the paediatric A&E department. I will never come back to this A&E department ever again.",1
180133,"My mother was in this hospital last year. When she was admitted 2 nurses tried to turn her over on the bed. She could not move herself very well and they moved her so close to the edge of the bed while they were doing it that she nearly fell off. Obviously she was very scared by this but she was told off for being silly. On another occasion , my mum was supposed to be moved to another hospital, the woman who came to collect her asked her to get into a wheelchair. My mum could just not physically do this as she was so ill and in pain. The woman told my mum that she just wasn't trying hard enough and bullied her into keep trying when she was in great pain. In the end it became clear that my mum was not able to do it, but had been put through much pain and humiliation in the process - she phoned me later crying. My mum has since died (she went to another hospital where the care was so much better), but on her death bed, she was still frightened of being turned because of her experience at Oxford.",1
154599,"Some weeks ago my daughter was admitted with right sided abdo pain and persistent vomitting and jaundice. On H3 my daughter was reviewed by a professor. He spoke over us whilst discussing my daughter with his registrar. I found him rude and insulting to my intelligence. It had been noted that my daughters liver was enlarged. Her liver function tests were all deranged. The professor suggested the reason for this was that she had been taking too many paracetamol 'paracetamol can cause this' he said. I asked why she was not under Hep Bil if this was a liver problem; he said 'this is a general medical problem'. When I tried to explain that she hadn't taken any more than what is the recommended daily dose he completely dismissed me. My daughter has now had surgery at another trust. She needed a lap choli and a common bile duct exploration. There were that many compacted gall stones the surgery took over three hours to perform. We were told she must have been unwell for some time, obviously nothing like what the prof suggested on H3. Absolutely disgusting.",1
154605,"My elderly mum was admitted to Treliske about a month ago, from the beginning we knew the admission was going to be a struggle. We were warned to ensure we spent as much time visiting as we could spare. This advice proved to be true , each visiting time there were constant interuptions with doctors, medicine , blood pressure checks etc along with meals just being left and collected when untouched, mainly due as many of the elderly patients could feed themselves. Our mum was discharged after being distressed for 4 days , rushed through due to bed shortages , sent home with a care plan/support plan that was not activated for 3 working days. Mum was on a ward with elderly people wandering around , some trying to escape , some nurses tried their best but the ward was clearly understaffed and run by a sister who just bellowed orders at staff and patients alike.",1

She was given a bed pan as she was bed bound, the nurse took it away and spilt it under her. My daughter was then left for 2 hours lying in her urine. When she begged the nurse to help her pain, the nurse asked her was she soft . She was also told to stop using her buzzer as hey were too busy to come to her. They failed to recognise swelling, extreme pain and discolouration of her leg. My daughter had compartment syndrome, by the time any medical person decided to look at her leg, 11 hours had passed. She was taken back to theatre and nearly lost her leg. It is now May and she has only just been allowed to put her foot down. I spoke to the sister on the ward to complain about what had happened and her nurses attitude, who basically told me she was off and it had nothing to do with her. I would not send any one to this hospital, it was a nightmare. Both myself and her partner were calling the hospital and were told she had settled, when in fact she was texting and calling us saying how much pain she was in. We informed them of this and they assured us she was ok, when in fact they had not even checked on her. All texts about compartment syndrome states, if a patient is in extremes pain, swelling etc patient just be taken back to theatre immediately. Her nursing care was the worst I have seen ever.",1

180222,"My wife and I had our first child this year. From start to finish I couldn't be happier with the service and quality of care provided. Without waxing on too too much: Preparation: water-birthing talks and delivery suite tours were very helpful and well organised. Delivery suite: the staff were very good, didn't jump to any hasty decisions and, due to the baby being in distress, the physician opted for a C-Section. My wife and I weren't consulted in this decision as much as told that this would be the best option. However, looking at the data they had at the time and the after-care this was 100% the best option for my wife and baby; and frankly I wouldn't wish to contradict years of experience with a random bit of knowledge from the internet! The facilities and staff were excellent from start to finish. Ante-natal ward (22): again, perfect. Close-attention to hygiene, understanding staff, hugely helpful to my wife (post-CS) even at 2am with an awkward new-born. Even security was reassuringly tight. Parking: this is where I normally get very angry. The parking eye was not only convenient but cost-effective. The scale of parking fees means that around £8 could have allowed me to park for all of my visits over those 4-5 days without going back to the ticket machine. As it happens I didn't realise this and paid for the first night, then the 2nd day, then the subsequent days so it cost me twice as much. But still it wasn't too bad and the parking app works a treat.",0

The quality of service has been good - staff at reception and the doctors and nurses have been polite and helpful and have given me sufficient information.

Three weeks after seeing the consultant I have had no communication, nor has my GP. Apparently the consultant's notes get sent to India to be typed up, then back to the Churchill, then over to the JR for printing and posting second class to my home address and to the GP. No word on the PSA test (from 3 weeks ago) or the flow rate test from the last week. Madness. I spoke to the secretary there today, and she is emailing me over the report, without any problem. In fact, as I am writing this, the letter has arrived. Suggestion: the consultant writes up his note at the time, copies it into an email, and then sends it to the GP and copies in the patient (if they have email). Now read the letter: I still have no results from the PSA test and the flow rate test, so I need to call them again....sigh.",0
157405,"Yes, the parking is poor. Yes, there are delays in pharmacy and long delays on the chemo suite. However, overriding this by a long way is the total dedication, exceptional care and understanding from my consultant. Add to that the kind, professional nurses, the respect shown by the reception and anciillary staff and that more than makes up for the rest. This kind of care doesn't come easy or cheap, we are all very lucky the staff make it possible in difficult times. From the bottom of my heart I would like to thank them.",0

I would love to be able to treated at another hospital and never have to go back to this one. Can see why Charing Cross should be closed.",0

157981,"I feel that Tameside hospital caused my pensioner mother to become so ill and immobile she has never recovered enough to return home. My mother was not physically ill or injured when she went to Tameside hospital, she was suffering from a form of psychosis. Earlier in the year she had spent two months on the mental health unit with the same problem. However, she made a full recovery without additional medication and continued to attend the unit as an outpatient. Five months later the symptoms returned and she was badly in need of psychiatric care. In late August 2013 she rang the police who arranged for an ambulance to take her to the hospital. From the moment she entered Tameside hospital she became a victim of what I feel were serious mistakes, followed by covering up and lies. My mother became so physically ill (while I feel they were ignoring her psychosis) that she was on a medical ward for a month. Then, still unwell she was moved to Grange view which is owned and run by Tameside hospital for a further two months. Even then my mother was not well enough to go home. Following three months of hospitalisation, lack of exercise and an ignored fall she never regained her mobility. She lost her voice when she had an allergic reaction and that too has not returned. She became deconditioned, depressed, withdrawn and unable to communicate. She was sent to a care home, where she remains in this state of deterioration. Sadly my mother will remain there for the rest of her days. Tameside hospital had her medical notes for reference. In addition, I gave the doctor from a&e her mother's medical history. I explained that my mother was a psychiatric patient and not physically ill. I gave details of her mother's medication including a penicillin allergy. Here are some examples of the unacceptable way my mother was treated by Tameside hospital: ( a ) refused to acknowledge she was a psychiatric patient, and have the psychosis she was presenting treated. ( b ) refused to contact her psychiatrist despite assuring me they would. (The only reason her psychiatrist became remotely involved is because I made direct contact with his office. This was when I discovered my mother was being discharged after 72 hours. I told the hospital that my mother was not leaving until she had been treated her psychosis. It was unsafe for her to leave. That was the reason she was brought to the hospital) ( c ) informed by staff the mental health unit was full, with a waiting list of three weeks ( d ) put her on a general medical ward, where she did not belong. Not only was she treated medically badly, she was humiliated by the situation, as some of the other patients considered her odd behaviour to be a source of amusement. ( e ) given four consecutive doses of an antibiotic to which they knew she had an allergy. ( f ) antibiotics were unnecessary anyway as all her tests results were clear ( g ) collaboration by the staff who did everything possible to cover their mistakes ( h ) failed to inform us about the mistakes, and that she had been given penicillin. ( I ) prevented her from attending a much needed appointment with her psychiatrist. ( j ) prevented her from seeing a social worker. ( k ) she had a fall which left her badly bruised My mother became very ill. She was immobile incontinent had breathing difficulties and lost her voice. For four days, I was frantic with worry as I watched my mother's health deteriorate and had no idea why. Yet the staff knew why, but did not say. I read her medical notes, and discovered my mother had been given penicillin. I confronted the nurse in charge, who refused to accept my mother was allergic to penicillin. This nurse became angry when I was said my mother was most definitely allergic to the drug, but still refused to add it to her notes. Days later when she developed a rash was this nurse was forced to admit it. However, the nurse still would not include it in her notes When I questioned the staff they denied all knowledge of her mother falling. However when she was admitted to Grange view three weeks later, the bruising was still bad enough to warrant photographs being taken by the person in charge. I made a formal complaint to the hospital, which was made up of twelve complaints. I also asked them to fund my mother's care costs, which is the least they could do. I was disgusted by their response and their refusal to fund my mother's care. The hospital exaggerated their apologies for the minor complaints, in an attempt to overshadow the more serious matters which have been denied. Tameside Hospital have played a huge part in my mother's quality of life being reduced to zero. She has given up, and although she is not dead, she may as well be according to her. She repeatedly tells me that she wishes she were dead. I do not give up easily, and will continue my plight to seek justice.",1
158165,"Sadly my mother died on the morning of Tuesday 22 April in Whttington Hospital. She was having problems breathing which she had had last year when she was treated at Chase Farm Hospital for fluid on the lungs and was up and about and off the oxygen after a week or two. It was not to be this time and I don't feel that adequate information was given to me on the severity of her condition. She was admitted to Whittington Hospital late on 10 April and given oxygen and water tablets. I had assumed incorrectly that the problem was the same as before, fluid on the lungs and she would get better in a few days. I was never told otherwise. She seemed to pick up over the week but a doctor rang me on the Friday before she died, a week after she was admitted, to say she was not doing too well and again on the Sunday when I was told that there was not much more they could do as she was on the highest level of oxygen she could be given which didn't seem to be enough. They could only ‘make her comfortable'. Mum had also had a urethral catheter fitted which, on two occasions, had blood in the tube. I mentioned this to the nurse who said 'nothing to worry about'. The day before she died when I asked the nurse why she was being given antibiotics I was stunned when she mentioned pneumonia, again I was unaware that mum had pneumonia. I think if someone is that ill, family should be made aware from the outset and not a day or two before they pass away that there is little that can be done. Mum suffered so much towards the end and must have been very frightened. Although they tried to make her comfortable, she was struggling to breathe and died in my arms.",1
158378,"My 20 year old son sustained a severe injury to his left foot last year. It was deemed as a significant injury which I understood to be potentially life changing. However my son found himself in skilled and expert hands, 6 months later, following 2 operations, he has been discharged from the hospital. Thank you so very much to all who were involved in his care - doctors, anaesthetists and nurses in Cobham Clinic. He was so well looked after and they ensured he was as pain free as possible. I would also like to give a special mentioned to an orthopaedic FY2 who supported my son throughout his week long stay in hospital. She was so kind to him and nothing was too much trouble. So thank you once again.",0
158339,"My 67 year old Mother was recently taken into Stepping Hill Hospital as an emergency after suffering a sudden onset of extreme pain in her groin. She had already been told by her GP that she had a hernia and had twice been scheduled for surgery at the hospital only to have both operations cancelled. The doctors who treated her were awful. My mother was told she did not have a hernia, was made to feel like she was causing a fuss and that basically there was nothing they could do other than send her to a pain clinic so she could have injections so she could live with the pain! On leaving she was given a discharge letter that stated she did have a hernia and after going to see her GP has also been told that the Hospital found she had an infection that they never even mentioned. As a result she is now going to go private to have her 'non-existant' hernia repaired by people who might actually treat her with some degree of repect and dignity I am DISGUSTED at the way she has been treated by this hospital and I will make sure she never goes back there again!",1
158308,"5 months after a GP referral made in Jan 2014 for an earbud removal (the process takes less than a minute with the right suction tool they use), I yet await an appointment. After long 'phone queue as the patient contact centre, given online as the line that deals with JR ENT, I reached helpful receptionist, she took details and tried unsuccessfully to ring through to fix the appointment, but after a long try, got back to explain that she could not at the time. (Does the Dept have enough lines to ring through on?) She helpfully said she'd email. Then I got another number and left a detailed voicemail, which I should hear back from. I ran a search online, and found a consultant's secretary's number, and left another detailed voicemail. It was at 1 point suggested I re-approach my GP for a further chaser or referral, but that oughtn't be needed, as he's busy, and that would mean duplication. ENT reception is double manned, so why isn't that number listed online?",0
158972,"My 15 month old neice was emergency admitted by her family GP with breathing difficulties; upon arrival the first question her parents were asked wasnt whats her name, whats the problem or even how old is she. NO the first question a nurse asked was what religion is she?!! My neice was then passed from pillar to post by staff, each one less competent/ interested than the last. My neice was finally diagnosed with a serious chest infection given medicine and sent home; even though a member of staff said she should have been admitted so an introvenous course of medicine could be administered to clear the infection with her being so young/poorly. Two weeks later my neice was blue lighted to hospital again by her GP as she could not breath?! This time she was diagnosed with severe/chronic asthma!? Did she get appropriate treatment? No. Instead a nurse pinned my 15 month old neice to a bed when she was scared of the inhaler mask being crushed onto her face at which point her mum physically threw the `nurse` out of the room.",1
159173,"I was sent to a+e from the walk in clinic from croydon with severe abdominal pain which they thought was appendicitis. When at a+e I was given an emergency card and told to wait. After having my bloods taken I was told i had inflammation in my blood but as I have pcos I had to be seen by a surgeon and a gynaecologist. After bring examined by the surgeon they admitted me to Queens ward 2 and I would see a doctor in the morning. I was woken up the next day being told I was going into surgery within the hour. After the operation I was taken back to Queens ward 2. Where I stayed for a couple of days. While I was on this ward after my surgery no one had checked my stitches or changed my bandages. I was in a room with a few old patients. The lady next to me was very distressed after when she was bought on the ward taking out her iv drips, not understanding what they were giving her. The staff spoke to her like she was a child and was laughing at the things she was saying. She wanted to call her son and repeatedly asked to but was repeatedly ignored. I ended getting out of my bed the day after my operation to help her call her son. One of the other elderly women was screaming to use the camode but was ignored rudely which resulted in her releaving herself in her bed which is unhygienic and humiliating especially in a room with 6 other people. During the night another patient informed a nurse that her colonoscapy bag need changing which the nurse told her she didn't know how to change that type of bag she will get another nurse. Which she did not do as in the morning the bag burst which is again unhygienic and humiliating for that patient. The nurses were terrible. The surgeon come round in the morning and told me i could home that day. I was handed my discharge papers by a nurse and told I could leave with out a nurse once changing my bandages which I could see the blood through, not being told what kind of stitches I had been given during surgery. I asked the nurse and she kissed her teeth and walked away. I was 25 and in a lot of pain still after the surgery as it was not appendicitis and they were not clear why I was in pain. I left and went to pals where they called the ward and the nurses refused to come down and talk to me. They ended calling the ward sister who came down and told me that I had to go back to the ward because my dressings need changing. Which she got the nurse to do who was rude all the way through changing my bandages. I had had surgery and was still in pain, and the nurses had no compassion for me or for any of the other patients. I am frankly disgusted that those people are being paid to take care of sick people. I would not recommend that ward for anyone to stay on. I left that day confused and upset with the care I had received and the care the other patients were receiving as well as still not knowing what was the cause of the severe abdominal pain I was still feeling.",1

The unit is spotless and every member of staff I encountered was really pleasant & reassuring. The whole process was well organised, they constantly check that you are the right patient, give you all the information about why you are there, what's going to happen etc and offer you every opportunity to ask questions. The findings are explained clearly with lots of helpful post procedure advice including GP letter, useful appropriate leaflets. They are a credit to the nursing Profession. Thanks to all.",0
159261,I attended A&E due to feeling extremely suicidal. I had previously attempted suicide and having survived was told I must tell others if I was to feel that desperate again. I attended the hospital really afraid I may take my life. The staff were rude and uncaring towards me. They seemed to have no respect for me or my survival. I was discharged feeling desperately frightened. I guess if I ended up killing myself they would just say that they felt I could keep myself safe. I wonder of they had a relative who was very suicidal if they would want them to be treated like that. - I very much doubt it. it is a very sad situation and one that I have heard from other people who have attended A&E when frightened and suicidal.,1
159285,"My husband was admitted to A&E with a chest infection that had turned into pneumonia. The treatment he received was excellent but what got left behind was his wife. None of the A&E staff, including the doctor treating my husband, spoke to me unless I first spoke to them. They did not tell me what was happening. They did not tell me he was being admitted to the hospital but simply moved his trolley away which prompted me to ask questions. I sat in the cubicle with him every second he was there but was still not informed about anything. What made this situation worse is that my husband is my primary carer and I was left in a very vulnerable situation without him.",0
159631,"My husband has not been referred to Orthopaedic department even though he has great difficulty walking and is falling daily. He has banged his head when falling and despite having a previous bleeding on the brain has not been offered help. He collapsed three weeks ago and was taken to Hammersmith hospital where he is a renal transplant patient. The doctors 'assumed"" that he had a urinary tract infection with very high temperature and creatinine levels. After a week he was sent home where he had a fall banging his head. 24 hours later he couldn't balance himself and has fallen continuously. He went to his GP who told him his legs feel strong and hasn't offered him a referral to an orthopaedic consultant. He has also not requested a neurological consultant because of the previous stroke he has had and to rule out any damage he might have done when he has banged his head. As his carer I don't know where to turn for help. My husband is 77 years old and I am wondering if this is a factor in the apparent lack of care.",1
160343,"A big thank you to the midwife team and the doctor who worked on the 1st May night shift. One month on, I still can't speak highly enough of the care and attention we received and the dedication shown during what must be a the long night shift for the staff when monitoring and making key decisions. All of this was very impressive and as expecting parents, was very reassuring to see. As our delivery wasn't straight forward, the team were very supportive and clear on the factors they were monitoring and the options they were considering whilst keeping us focussed on the next step. Eventually a C-section was required with the procedure being a success. Throughout the process the team encouraged my birthing partner's participation which was also appreciated. Post labour, the 2 days of care in the maternity ward was also excellent, with all the staff being supportive and helpful to my husband and I and our new addition. On a lighter note, TV shows can be quite misleading and simply don't give justice to what we've seen and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to promote our experience and the team. Whilst a team effort, I hope this feedback reaches named individuals. Thank you from all of us!",0
160439,"My granddad was admitted to the hospital by ambulance after being found unresponsive. Unfortunately for him, he was admitted on a Saturday and just before a bank holiday. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and spent the weekend in a hospital ward with an oxygen mask and antibiotics. My family were eventually able to speak to a Consultant 3 days after his admission (after the bank holiday of course!) and this was only possible at the insistence of a family friend who is a medical professional. My granddad was a diabetic, he was unconscious but moving his legs and of a slim build. He was therefore at high risk for developing pressure ulcers. However, no immediate action was taken by anyone caring for him. He was eventually given an air mattress on Monday afternoon after developing two sores on his feet. The two ulcers were not recorded on the ward charts as they should have been. Why was this? In any event, my granddad's condition remained stable but critical. Attempts were made to fit a tube through his nose and down his throat for his medication and food but it was clear that this was causing him great distress. We were assured that they had succeeded on the third attempt. However, he still remained incredibly distressed. During my last visit with him, I was only able to be with him for 10 minutes as I could not cope with the pain he was in (I am pregnant and did not want to cause distress to my unborn child). His screams could be heard outside the main doors of the ward and past the nurses' station but no-one seemed to care. I have never heard my granddad raise his voice but my last memory of him will be of him lying in his hospital bed, mouth covered with blood sores and oral thrush and screaming out in pain. Did anyone help him? Did anyone try and calm his distress? No. We were not even given oral sponges regularly to moisten his mouth despite the fact that he had had no food or drink for 7 days. The nurses were insensitive and rude anyway so asking them for anything was out of the question – unless you wanted a tirade of abuse for caring about your loved one. My granddad passed away 7 days after being admitted. The question I have for the nurses and doctors who treatment my granddad are – if that was your father or grandfather, would you have left them screaming out in pain so loudly? Would you have let them develop pressure ulcers on their feet the way my granddad did? Would you have been satisfied if they had lay in a hospital bed for three days before being seen? I accept my granddad was very unwell and that his time to leave us had arrived. However, just because he was old and unwell, surely the care he received should still not have been as appalling as it was. Surely he deserved to die with some dignity. The nurses showed no compassion. They had no interest in caring for the patients. Iam appalled and disgusted by what I have seen over the time my granddad was there. I would not wish such indignity on my worst enemy.",1

Sadie Dunne, Lead Nurse for Learning Disabilities, arranged the visit for us so that we could find out more about A&E and take some photographs for a possible easy read guide. We were made very welcome by Karen Meroz, the Learning Disability A&E lead, who took us through an imaginary visit. She was both informative and extremely helpful in guiding us through the service. We met a variety of friendly and helpful staff, many of which, were even willing to pose for photographs for the easy read guide. As well as A&E we were well received everywhere from Ambulance through to CT scans and X-rays. This was an extremely reassuring visit in terms of assessing the attitude of the service towards people with learning disabilities and we look forward to producing a easy read guide that reflects this.

One lady even had a panic attack over it. I had to comfort her. Also, the washing facilities were disgusting. I have spent a few times in Medway and this was the most awful experience.

This time I needed to speak to someone because I was expecting a letter through the post for an appointment which never came.

166181,I went by ambulance with a frail elderly friend to A and E. She had a very obviously fractured hip. She was ignored for ages. I repeatedly asked for someone to see her and give her some sort of pain relief. The male chart nurse who eventually sauntered over then disappeared fo ages. By this time my friend was desperate for the loo. She was in agony and was grey. The charge nurse eventually came back with two paracetamol tablets but no water to take it with. He seemed more concerned to have a chat and banter with the ambulance drivers than help my friend. Everything took ages and was done in a very offhand and unprofessional manner. Once my friend was admitted onto the orthopaedic ward things vastly improved but Aand E was a horrible experience mainly because of the casual attitude of the staff.

After approx. 3mins an ambulance car was at our house...Craig the paramedic took over the care of my son. He knew straight away what the problem was and gave my son the best treatment available. I know Craig saved his life and for that I'm truly grateful and thankful. I would also thank the paramedics who helped Monday when he suffered another anaphylaxis shock just after arriving at work. My son is now waiting to see a specialist and hopefully we will get to know what caused this. Once again huge thank you to Craig and paramedic team who I believe saved me from losing my son.",0
166285,"My farther was diagnosed with lung cancer and a secondary brain tumour last year he was given the news at first that it was treatable with chemotherapy and radiation treatment he was given by the Macmillan staff a booklet with all the dates to come in for treatment were to go and what to expect when he came in we understood that this would only buy him a little more time, we came home told the entire family we were kind of releaved the first appointment came I took my mum and dad to the hospital he just wanted to be with my mum so I left them there, After driving home I received a phone call to go straight back. when I arrived both my parents were quite stunned they were told he was terminal with six weeks to live. In my opinion the Macmillan staff had misled both my parents, they had given them false hope. Telling them basically he should just go home to die we had no further help from this hospital or the Macmillan staff. I feel they basically washed there hands of my dad and offered him no support. I can say that my dad died in May and he did die at home and he was with his family who looked after him without any support from Macmillan staff the only help and support we got was from a very dedicated family g. p and his nursing staff at his surgery. So in summing up yes we understand my dad was seriously ill and that he was diagnosed here but that was all and I for one will never support Macmillan after the poor treatment he received.",1
166438,"Had a course with neurophysio, in gym and hydrotherapy pool, for MS. It's a boring condition: you're not going to get better - just aim to slow down your rate of decline! The physio was encouraging, clear, and quickly understood what my problems were (everyone with MS is different). I had five or six sessions in the gym and then in the pool, and left with an exercise programme for home and the pool. Like many people with MS, my symptoms are worse in hot weather, hot rooms etc. The hydrotherapy pool is much warmer than a swimming pool, but I decided to try it once in case it was useful. As it turned out, it was great - didn't worsen spasticity, did relax muscles so I could stretch more, and the water supports some of your weight so things are generally easier to manage. One problem was that for my first session the changing room was uncomfortably hot (staff were drying it out, I think, with a fan heater) and I lay on the floor to get cooler. For the rest of the sessions, the changing room was fine. Staff available to help with changing, transfer etc if needed; cheerful, friendly. Star rating: I've given 3 stars for the hospital (I'm recommending neurophysio treatment, not the whole hospital), and 3 stars for same-sex accommodation. The changing room and the pool are mixed (with curtained off cubicles for changing) - I don't mind at all, but others may. I don't know whether there are any women- or men-only sessions. I've given 5 stars for the rest - excellent facilities and treatment. It's possible to continue hydrotherapy (after being signed off), following the programme suggested by the physio, at a charge of around £6 a 30-minute session. I had some trouble getting through to the Private Patients Office to book my sessions (5 phone calls and an email ...) but when they eventually answered the phone they were pleasant and efficient. Overall, great.",0
166947,"My father died at Manchester Infirmary following a catalogue of failures of care in the community from his own GP and the care workers assigned to his care at home. Being terminally ill in addition to his ongoing health issues the GP failed to provide adequate support and district nurses failed to recognise the signs of kidney failure. By the time he arrived in A&E in hospital he was very ill and later died. During his hospital stay he was robbed, subjected to aggressive patients and a lack of care from overstretched staff. One example is a chamber pot under his bed had been knocked over and remained in that state for 2 days and until I insisted staff deal with it. This is not unusual and I have had many experiences of this when other members of my family have been hospitalised. My brother being terminally ill and blind was left to fed himself in a hospital in Cambridge. My mother was was about to be discharged from Trafford hospital fell and was transferred to Altrincham hospital against P&P and suffered a stroke which went unrecognised by new staff. She never recovered and died after days of a total lack of care weighing less than 5 stone. I have worked as a manager in the NHS passionate to make a difference in mental health.",1

He was admitted in excruciating pain unable to bend or walk without screaming in pain. A doctor quickly made her assessment by prodding his legs , he was then given ""paracetamol"" then about 20mins later was given diazepam and told to leave!! Whilst struggling along the corridors he passed nursing staff and doctors and not one of them offered any assistance whatsoever, his pregnant fiancée 23weeks had to struggle to hold him up! If this is care then God help us getting ill! Believe me though this is not a matter I will be brushing under the carpet!",1

167164,"Got admitted in march after a series of blackouts to be diagnosed with wpw syndrome, while I was in recordings were not made of my tachycardia even though the machine was reading 180 bpm, because this evidence was not kept cardiologists were unconvinced I had suffered tachycardia as it was not on my records,I was also suffering major headaches and pulsatile tinnitus but no investigation was made even though I had hit my head on the hard floor when I blacked out, When I was discharged a junior registrar first told me there was nothing wrong with me until I told them the doctor had diagnosed wpw syndrome, my discharge records also stated I was a lady even though my name at the top clearly said Mr, my discharge notes were also signed by a pediatrician and not a doctor from the cardiac ward, also when I was discharged I nearly collapsed on the way out and had to be helped to the front door, In my opinion this hospital fails to diagnose patients properly or do further investigations to save money. I should have been given a MRI scan to determine if any damage had occurred when I hit my head. Do not go here if you have any head injuries as they do not investigate properly. Also they did not give me any discharge notes to give to my doctor, who I might add was furious. Its a shame as the doctor is a good doctor but I feel he is let down but those around him and lack of funding",1
167081,"Just home from a total hip replacement and I have nothing but praise for the whole EOC experience. Right from scheduling to discharge, everything was highly efficient but also highly human. Information before admission included a DVD, which gives a preview of what to expect, as well as demonstrating exercises. Staff at all stages & in all areas were kind, efficient & friendly - pre-op assessment, pre-theatre, theatre, PACU & the ward, physio and discharge. I was on Oaks, but have no reason to think the other ward wasn't just as good. The building itself is clean, bright and airy and although everyone is fanatical about infection control, the whole place just smells clean & fresh without that typical 'hospital' smell. The suite I was in was a really bright, spacious room for four. We were all very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food: each day we chose from an extensive a la carte menu and food was hot, tasty and decent portions. ALL staff (clinicians, cleaning, catering) were chatty, friendly & helpful and they all seemed happy to help patients, and each other. There was none of that ""That's not my job"" attitude. The EOC seems a great place to work - there was lots of laughter and the staff really seem to get on well, which makes for a lovely atmosphere. I'm so, so impressed and so very grateful to all the staff involved in my care. I knew EOC was world class in terms of surgery, but it is also world-class in terms of staff, environment and care. HUGE thanks to everyone at Epsom EOC - & congratulations on a superb service.",0
167291,"My daughter was admitted when her bladder stopped working in early stages of pregnancy. There had been bleeding the week before, which she was admitted for and dismissed immediately. The doctor she saw was very dismissive and patronising. Once she was admitted for the bladder problems, the doctors at the hospital seemed to ignore the fact that her bladder was not working and only concentrated on the pain that accompanied it. Their whole attitude was very condescending towards her and it wasn't until one nurse took on board the real problem that action seemed to be taken. But even then, the doctors still seemed to harp back to the wrong symptoms/notes. I have not felt I could leave her alone, as I felt that some of the staff have been downright cruel and neglectful. I have been sleeping on the chair beside her so that I can care of her properly.",0
167597,"With 2 sporty children I have attended Altrincham's Minor Injury Unit fairly regularly over recent years. Waiting times have ranged from 5 minutes to 1 hour depending on day of the week or time of day but never excessive and usually good. The service is excellent, great staff, very kind, patient and caring. Always very thorough and often going above and beyond to help. Looking forwards to the new hospital opening, the staff will then have a building that reflects the standard of work they are doing. Whenever I've been I'm always very grateful we have access to such a service.",0

The days when the services is accessible to community health patients are restricted to specific days and specific times. There is absolutely no information on the website about either the service or the days and times the service is accessible by GP patients. I have got absolutely no idea who runs the phlebotomy services at this hospital.

168484,"My friend was in AEU in Wigan Infirmary 3 weeks ago and was disgusted with the treatment. The attitude of the nurses was appalling resulting in my friend being left on her own without help. My friend also had to assist a patient in a nearby bed to eat as no one was helping her. Also the decorators came in and my sick friend was moved rooms 4 times which is appalling. It was so bad that my friend discharged herself as she believed she would have died there had she stayed. She needed antibiotics but the doctor refused to prescribe any for her, laughing at her. She ended up going to see her GP who sorted her prescription out when she got home.",1

For the last few weeks of her life she was taken off her morphine which she had been on for some years. This lead her to become incoherent and with terrible pain. She was left unwashed, covered in excrement and urine which led to ulcers which you could put your fist in. Her body became rigid so turning became so unbearably painful we couldn't turn her anymore. The last two weeks of her life they stopped her drip, my family tried in vain to give her fluids and food. The last three days of her life the staff stopped her foods and didn't bother trying to give her a drink. My family were with her doing shifts between us all until she passed away.

169279,"I recently had an X-Ray taken at RBBC. I was offered a choice of dates/times and chose 9am on a Saturday morning. The building was fairly easy to find, there was plenty of parking spaces. The inside of the building was bright, tidy and very clean. The staff at both the main and X-Ray reception were polite, helpful, friendly and efficient. I had arrived early and was seen early, only having to wait 3 or 4 minutes while some paperwork was completed. I was treated very professionally by the person who took the X-Ray, she explained what was going to happen and what I needed to do as she went through the process. At the end of the appointment I was told how long it would be before the X-Ray was with my GP. I was extremely impressed with everything about the appointment.

169258,"Having lost our mother 23/01/2014 it is with time to speak out about the events that occurred in from 2011 to 2014. Mum broke her right ankle 7th December 2011 and was admitted to UHCW where a non weight bearing plaster cast was administered after on xray revealed a fracture to the Fibular however there was anothe fracture that was ignored to the Tibia /Ankle joint . when the cast was removed in February 2012 mum was given an air boot at this point only the Fibular was xrayed again, in the March 2012 mum had an appointment at the Fracture clinic she told the doctor that the ankle felt as it was still broken his reply was the only thing wrong with you is that you are Obese and Lazy and refused to check the foot again this left mum in immense pain and she found it very difficult to walk because o f the existing fracture. On 6th August 2012 at approximately 0200 hrs mum went to the toilet and had a fall she crawled to the top of the landing anddown 3 stairs to another small landing where she pulled herself up holding on to the small bannister and climbed back up the 3 steps. Then mum fell backwards at the top of her staircase and landing on top of my sibling that was her carer causing severe injury to my sibling's right knee and right wrist mum also was injured one of the worn discs in her back had crumbled and was laying on the main nerve to her spine, the ambulance crew and 3 family members lifted mum and put her back into bed before they took the sibling to hospital they told my youngest sister to call mums doctor out to get her assessed, when infact they should have also called for antother ambulance crew to take mum to hospital as they should not have moved her. When I arrived at my mums home I was told of the full scale of my siblings injuries annd what the ambulance crew had done I was to say the least horrified that they had not taken mum to hospital at the same time. I called the doctor myself and told him that mum needed to be assesesd in hospital as she was 85 years of age and had no carer to look after her at this point mum could not even get out of bed to go to the toilet as she could not even stand up so she bals became semi incontinent. The Doctor finally arrived to assess mu 4 hours after I had called him at 08:20 am he called an ambulance to take her into hospial. When she arrived at the hospital they found the existing fracture to her right ankle and also x- rayed her back they administered another on weight bearing plaster cast then moved her to ward 52, the worst part of this is that the doctor treating my sibling visited my mum on ward 52 and these are the words that he spoke to a vulnerable adult , "" You do realise the injury you have caused your daughter "" Which I personally find extremely apalling considerinf the Trauma mum was going through at that point. and to make things worse he did not consider why mum had fallen was due to the hospitals neglect in the first place,",1
169312,"I have just received a parking penalty of a possible £70. It would appear that I stayed 13 seconds too long ,yes that's right,in the car park. At the pay point they ask you to take a note of the time of entry,in my case 10.17 was printed on the ticket. I noted the time on the machine near the exit and exited at 1044 When the penalty arrived it times your entry and not when you purchase the ticket . Although seconds are not printed on the ticket it would appear the computer counts in seconds. All too ridiculous. Unless you give a printed time of entry and exit how on earth can we be expected to know if additional payment is required. Of course on appeal they have waived the fee as a gesture of goodwill. Why are our hospitals dealing with such spurious companies?",0
169340,"I was referred by my Doctor for an ultra sound scan. There is no way to make an appointment by phone because the reception staff need you to bring the referral form with you. I attended on 24 June, which involved taking a morning off work and spending £3.00 to park in the hospital car park. The earliest appointment I could get was for 6 August, and there are big notices to warn that your Doctor will not get the results for up to 2 weeks after the scan - that's 8 weeks between referral and scan result. The staff were clearly over-worked and under strain. In this age of technology when most people have smart phones and internet access, it is ridiculous that you cannot request an appointment by phone or e-mail and then send the form by fax or e-mail during the inevitable 6 week delay until the appointment. It is also ridiculous that you need to miss time off work and spend money on parking just to come to the hospital to get an appointment. There must be a more efficient way of dealing with this process to make life easier for patients and staff alike.",0

Daughter accidentally sat on a huge splinter at school in playhouse and wife rushed her to Mt Vernon hospital. After 2 hours of waiting daughter was obviously in a lot of pain and she saw a nurse who we presumed would attempt to take the splinter out but because daughter was crying (obviously) she would not treat her. Therefore nurse told them to go to Hillingdon hospital, which was rediculous. Here the doctor saw wife/daughter after another 1 hour wait and drive and the doctor kindly took the splinter out. He could not believe that Mt Vernon would not treat Miranda (my daughter).",1

The Road Traffic Act or any other Act does not set out the timings for driving after any sedation, procedure or medication, In fact, just because the anaesthetist says you can drive at any time you should only do so if you consider yourself fit and well to drive.

My friend was haemorrhaging really bad from down below. While in hospital they threw away clots and samples that were meant to be sent away to be examined, they then sent her home wearing just a hospital gown with no shoes on and covered in dry blood she had to ask for a blanket to wrap around herself. Then whilst waiting for someone to pick her up she passed out in the waiting room, her sister asked for assistance and was told she will have to wait until they were finished talking to a patient. I'm assuming she was treat like this because she was in the beer garden of a pub when it happened and when she arrived at hospital the staff assumed she was a drunken idiot on a Saturday night out. Not the case at all we were all frightened due to the amount of blood that was gushing out of her. In total she lost 700mls of blood and passed clots and was treated for a bad period, my friend had an abortion two months ago and had the pill injection afterwards, definitely not a period.",1

My wife is coeliac and the symptoms untreated can be life threatening. In both instances A and E were excellent. I both cases it was difficult to find a ward bed as she needed isolation, the second admission involved staying 2 days in A and E. It is a rather harsh environment but I feel they did their best. I wish she did not have to be moved at 3am in the morning. Sleep is not the top priority in hospitals. I have two issues with the hospital upset my wife, affected endangered her and brought to tears of desperation. During her first visit and prior to being discharged she was told by a gastroenterology consultant ""this is not a hotel, we deal with life and death issues here and I have other patients to see"" My wife in a distressed state had tried to explain that she still felt desperately unwell and exhausted after nights without sleep, nauseous and having waited eleven and a half hours on nil by mouth for an endoscopy she could stand no longer. It was 11.30 am when she gave up but even so she would have continued had the ward received any idea of timing from the gastroenterology department. This is the first issue, The condition in which she was discharged virtually guaranteed her return as a emergency. The discharging consultant ignored the basic symptoms, nausea and diarrhoea, which brought her in if and showed absolutely no empathy at all. When told she could not or drink he advice was ""try"", his words. Secondly, when readmitted my wife had the endoscopy procedure she should have had on the previous visit but this turned out just as nightmarish. Nil by mouth from early morning she was eventually sent down at 3.15pm after a seven hour wait in the ward only to be kept waiting and ignored in the endoscopy department. Remember my wife was nauseous and had diarrhoea and nothing to drink for 10 hours. She was desperate and would have crawled out of there if she felt she could have found her way out. her exact words. Overall very poor patient care and I could go on but but life is too short. A and E good but harsh and I certainly feel the gastroenterology is basically brilliant with the exception of patient care and the odd consultant who should review his career choice.",1

The staff in the department are friendly and professional and go out of their way to make patients feel comfortable and relaxed.

In an ideal world they could provide a better service if they had an extra 20 staff but given the current economic climate that's not likely to happen!,0

This is perfect example of the right way to run a Unit (and post-care ward). Always impressed with Southampton staff, and this was no exception.",0
175468,"As part of work that Patient Opinion are doing with the South London Health Innovation Network, we have been working with volunteers to generate some feedback about diabetes care. As well as the individual stories being shared about the service, here are some general comments about the Diabetes Clinic at Kings. Patients were asked what they liked about the clinic: ""The staff are good, the processing of getting blood samples – because they know me, they go straight to the point – it's not painful and very quiet and accurate."" ""They gave me a pump, it gave me a new lease of life. Using the pump in the last few months has made a big difference to me"" ""I like the way the receptionist always address me by my first name."" ""Having your name show up on the screen that shows you when its time to go through for your appointment is a good thing."" ""The hospital is first class because I enjoy coming here"" Patients were asked what could be done better: ""I would like more research on African nutrition, there is not enough information about West African food and carbohydrate values. I find that the senior staff are very direct."" ""I would like to get to see a doctor more often instead of a nurse."" Patients were also asked about the contact between clinic visits: ""Instead of having a message on a machine when I phoned the diabetes team, it would be better if I have a telephone number to ring instead of coming to A&E when I need urgent treatment which is very expensive."" ""I have no problem with contact between visits."" ""I would prefer to be contacted via e-mail."" ""Face to face is better but I don't mind telephone or text."" ""Telephone call or text would be fine."" ""The staff are great because when you need an urgent appointment they are happy to arrange that.""",0
175515,"Sunday – Care here is very good, no complaints. The staff all show respect and are very friendly. The care is high quality. Staff come quickly when mum presses the button. It's a nice clean ward but needs more chairs for the visitors, the chairs should be checked because one had a loose screw the other day. Staff are very knowledgeable and I have all the information about mums care and I know all that I need to do about mums care and also about the discharge arrangements, I know when the carers are coming in. The architecture on the Wandle ward is very good, the colour are nice and bright.",0
175595,This is on behalf of my mother Mrs Bridges who was brought into A &E Majors by ambulance. The nursing staff were neither polite or helpful. My mother suffers with alzheimers and I consider the way she was treated by the nurses was disguisting. She was shown to a toilet and left there to find her own back to the bed which she was not able to do and then became upset and cross as she was frightened and confused. The nurses spoke to my father and myself very rudely very short and sharp as if we were a total nuisance. My father waited over 2 hours for an Doctor to see my mother which I do not believe is acceptable. She was sent home the same day and my father was told to get a Drs appointment and get my mother refered for an endoscopy which I feel could & should have been carried out whilst she was still in the hospitals care and why wasnt she kept in over night to be monitored-my father is nearly 80 years old he should not have to be worrying that my mother could have a repeat of the mornings problems! The way we were treated we felt that we were was a drain on the NHS resources!,1
176705,"My daughter who is 7 months pregnant was admitted to the maternity ward in the early hours of Sunday 24th of August 2014. she was brought in from Pontefract A&E after suffering symptoms of pre eclampsia . She is due to have her baby at the LGI in Leeds but went to Pontefract because it was the nearest A&E which you would if you are ill. Staff were fine at Pontefract and an ambulance took her to Pinderfields. I am apalled at how she was treat in the maternity department not by the doctors but by the midwives. She was told constantly that she should not be at the hosptial and made to feel very unwelcome, all of this at a time when she was suffering , worrying about her unborn baby and very vulnerable. Luckily she was discharged the next day but had to endure one last dig from the midwife, who went and prodded the front of my daughters notes and said next time go there where it said LGI hospital . It is disgraceful it is the national health service clue is in the national and if you are ill and in danger surely you have the right to be treat at the nearest place that can deal with it !",0

I received a letter ! from Maxillo-Facial surgery on th 26th August ( 20 days) askin my to ring appointments for a date. Rang today and was given the 22 of September! that's 46 days plus the tow weeks in pain for my dentist to ask for help form Maxillo-facial, so it takes about 56 days of pain to see a “consultant”! and people say the NHS is on its last legs..",0

It feels like staff cant wait to get rid of you when you arrive at a&e They seem tired and uninterested. my son should of been kept in in my opinion with adominal pain vomiting and swollen testicals but they sent him home but I saw people with hangovers get put on a drip and given a bed! My child is 13! Not happy and thinking of taking things further a very worried and distressed mum at the moment,1

Attempts were made to take blood but due to dehydration this was not possible. She was not hydrated and left sitting waiiting to see a Dr who eventually discharged her with Gaviscon.,.She was also told ultra sounds were only for emergencies! She received no care was given no explanations and discharged with a letter to seek gastro investiga.tions Following another episode this week she was admitted to our local hospital Stepping Hill where the care was first class.

177339,"Labour with second child. Arrived at hospital 4. 30 and sent home after being examined and told cervix was still closed. Went downstairs in hospital and was in agony. One of the hospital staff saw me and the pain I was in and took me back upstairs in a wheelchair. Midwife looked at me and almost refused me entry back into room as she believed I should have gone home. Pain was unbearable asked for pain relief but was refused as told my cervix wasn't even dilating. Begged and begged for pain relief was left alone in room for what seemed an eternity, had to ask again and was finally brought some paracetamol and another tablet which took half an hour to kick in. Partner had to run bath. Within 20 minutes of being in bath told midwife the head was here she told me to stop being silly it was just my waters. Screaming in agony I felt the need to push, midwife shouted for gas and air and out popped my babies head and body. I was traumatised due to the dismissive manner of midwife and in shock. If I'd of gone home my baby would have been delivered in the car. Even afterwards I had to remind the midwife about my first passing of urine after birth and harshly handed a jug which I balanced on bed to try and remove from its packing. The midwife also scolded me for not holding baby immediately after birth whilst propping myself up in bath and taking second s to recover.",1
177560,"My 82 year old Father had a chest x-ray 18 months ago at the JR. There was a suspicious mark on his lung and it was flagged for him to be recalled in 6 weeks. This was never done and now it has developed into a cancerous tumor the size of a small grapefruit. He was admitted to the JR where his treatment has been appalling. Myself and my two sisters have done nothing but chase for basic care - emptying his catheter, asking for painkillers, asking doctors to look at his throat, even having to find out about pulped meals as he couldn't swallow! He had nurses mixing all his medication in one cup and making him drink it until we complained. He was overdosed on morphine for a few days. He even had one nurse making him drink mouth wash! It wasn't until we complained to PALS that we saw the matron (until then I didn't even realise they still had them) and she admitted that she had had 3 other complaints about the staffing on her ward. It just seemed one catastrophe after another, if it wasn't so serious we would have been laughing in disbelief. When he did start his radiotherapy they forgot to book his transport back to the JR from the Churchill and he was sat waiting for 6 hours. Now that he is home, we dropped his paperwork into his Doctors and they have just phoned to say that they had no idea he had been in hospital, they had not been told a thing and was very concerned about his health from the last time they had seen him. Why doesnt that surprise me!!!!!!",1
181569,"Unfortunately, due to medical problems, I have recently had to visit several different departments within DVH and in the main, have always experienced excellent care and treatment - however, I feel that the staff within the Gynaecology/Urodynamics etc. Department, truly go that extra mile: from the moment you enter, you receive a warm welcome and the atmosphere is friendly - even when waiting to be called, the nurses (and even the majority of medical professionals and Consultants) actually acknowledge you and smile - they don't just walk past, head down, as if you are invisible (which is unfortunately the norm in some other departments). I would personally like to say a big thank you and well done to the staff in Urodynamics. The nurses (always smiling!) and reception. But also thank you to all the staff within the Department including the consultant and to give them the positive recognition they deserve.",0

177804,"After my steroids were rapidly and incorrectly tapered, I became psychologically disturbed. The nurses, one in particular, seemed unforgiving. She shouted at me for feeling panicky and was rude to my parents who visited. I was in tears and became excessively nervous and terrified. The lead nurse of the ward behaved oddly. She knew that it was her junior's fault but seemed helpless. The night nurses I met were moody, nasty and unforgiving. 18 months on, I still have nightmares. The cleaner openly complained about how she had to clean the toilet after I had showered And that this was too much work. The consultant was incompetent who dealt with my case poorly as my health was deteriorating. Thankfully, he was then ousted out after a senior consultant took over and saved my life. This NHS staff need to realise that one day they may become unwell. What needs to be improved: everything. I also felt that I was singled out in terms of my bad experience on the ward being the only black patient. I think that staff I met seemed ignorant in terms of culture and needs. There were no water can facilities for people who use water in the toilet. I am forever traumatised and wish that I am never in hospital again. I was so upset by this terrible experience that I voluntarily left hospital with permission and then had to return. After discharge, I felt like I had been taken out of jail after severe torture.",1

I won't be attending again, her bedside manner is seriously lacking and I am now taking my daughter to BRI instead. My daughter told me that she felt upset with her dismissive attitude.

We were left for four hours while routine patients were seen as they waited for an x-Ray from the casualty dept he had been in all night. No sleep or food for 12 hours he was exhausted and in shock. When he was eventually seen by a very nice but exhausted registrar he was x-rayed immediately. Shocking treatment. Unnecessary and very poor decision making. How inefficient the administration is for this establishment and un sympathetic. If you try to ring no one answered. Referral for my other son was lost also.,0

Whenever we need help outside the chemo we get referred to Arrowe Park Hospital A&E. Because while Clatterbridge have a very nice looking Cancer Care unit they seem to be able to provide no care to my dad other than chemo on the days he is meant to get it. He was seen at Arrowe park in a state of breathlessness. Not by an oncologist because they have no onsite oncology staff. They do have a visiting oncology member from Clatterbridge who is there during the day in the week. He was then told his oxygen levels were fine and left in an overwhelmingly hot bay for the next hour. My sister asked twice when he would see the doctor, as my dad felt worse, and both times was told they would have to wait. In the end my dad was so exhausted he left. Why does someone who is terminally ill with cancer have to wait in an ordinary a&e? Next to infectious people - the guy next to my dad they overheard was being given some serious antibiotics for an infection. What if my dad had caught it? It could kill him. It's a disgrace. My dad has been left feeling ignored, frightened and still exhausted and breathless. We are waiting to speak to Clatterbridge to see if they can offer some better solution than sending him to Arrowe park to be ignored and finally treated by doctors who are not oncologists.",0
178717,"My son was admitted to Grantham A&E in early August with pain in right side of abdomen. Drs who he was seen by said it looked like it was his appendix. He was admitted to Lincoln via ambulance and pain relief given as his pain subsided, then kept him over night and discharged in the morning. They said it was a grumbling appendix. At grantham they did a blood test and said his white blood count was high, at Lincoln they said his blood was fine. He since has two other episodes, which we were able to control with over the counter pain relief. Then the last encounter in early September, we had to call an ambulance as he was racked in pain being sick. Morphine was given for pain, then he was taken to Lincoln A&E. When we arrived, my son was in pain. They gave pain killers and took blood. After a while, as his pain once again went, they came back and said his white blood cells where raised and gave him intravenous antibiotics. He was still being sick with the pain. A Dr in A&E said that as my son's pain has started to go that he was not sure it was appendix and he was gong to discharge him back to out GP, for a scan to ensure it was appendix. So we are in a hospital, but they would not give him a scan? The Dr said he would discharge him with liquid morphine, then we were told they were moving him to the surgical assessment unit for a scan and because he white blood cells where raised. We were then seen by the dr and waited for surgeon. No scan given. The surgeon came, discharged him and said it was not his appendix. So we had a surgeon at Grantham saying appendix, one at Lincoln saying it was not, people on A&E saying he had an infection, then being told on the surgical ward he didn't. I am really disappointed with my son's care it seems that no one knows what is wrong with him and he is given medication to mask the problem.",1

At good hope they understood she was high risk to falling and had bed alarms and low bed with crash mats. Heartlands hospital had no such equipment and even so had they transferred her back within a few hours this would not have happened.

274634,"Copy of my letter to Haematology Dept. 3 September 2014 Dear [doctor] [...] I was referred to you on 1 October 2013 and it was subsequently decided to address my iron overload with a series of venesections which commenced in April 2014 when my ferritin was above 800 ug/l. I am now well into the course and pleased to be making very good progress, indeed the treatment is reducing my ferritin levels at an astonishing and apparently increasing rate. My last two (or three) sessions have reduced my ferritin from 401 ug/l in mid June to 118 ug/l in mid August. As this far exceeds my expectations and possibly yours, I thought it would be prudent to draw your attention to this progress. I have made some minor dietary changes including vitamin B12 supplements which may have contributed marginally but would welcome a professional opinion that might explain my progress. May I also take this opportunity to compliment your staff in the PIU clinic, they are absolutely wonderful, flexible with appointments, competent, cheerful and helpful. They are a credit to your service and Leighton Hospital. Kind regards, D..... H.......",0

183266,"My daughter was admitted on numerous occasions to the childrens ward with severe abdominal pain. We found we were not taken seriously. We rarely saw the same doctor twice, all asked for back history and all had their own theories on what was wrong. Noone took a real intetest neither did we feel anyone cared about how to make my daughter better. The bath was broken. We werent not offered any towels whilst in hospital and the showered flooded the ward. Noone came to replace fluids of checked what my daughter ate or drank. Pain relief was slow in coming and Doctors brushed her pain off everytime as either period pain or IBS. Surely you dont treat period pain with Morphine! Food quality was appalling. In the end we paid to go private. The consultant was caring and put an action plan together. She was operated on shortly after her GCSEs privately and theu found a heavy load of adhesions on her ovary which had been causing this pain. Untreated this can lead to eptopoc pregnancies and infertility. The NHS refused to explore avenues, instead stick a sticky plaster over it and hope it goes away. How can I have any future faith in the NHS?",1
183391,"My son was very ill last year and was referred to the paediatric outpatients clinic where the paediatrician did lots of tests suspecting possible Systemic Lupus. His blood tests showed positive ANA low ferritin and low C4. He was anaemic with continuous leg pains. His blood was monitored and the C4 was still low. He was given iron supplements and picked up slightly but developed other quite disturbing symptoms which I was advised by a Lupus helpline could have been indicative of Lupus. We attended another appointment to be told that my son had been passed on to another paediatrician who completely played down his symptoms and instantly discharged him. Now a few months later he has more symptoms. He should never have been discharged and a formal complaint will follow. Disgusting! I took him back to the drs who were equally as disgusted who referred him again to LRI who then sent the referral without informing myself or the drs to another hospital to deal with it? Consequently the referral got lost in the system causing even more delays! Now he's under a hospital who have never seen him before who didn't even have his notes when I went for his initial appointment and had no idea what the original paediatrician was assessing him for, what tests had been done or treatment given. But the worst thing is that My son is still ill and has been neglected in our opinion! Awful hospital!",1

There is a drinks machine now which is free & helps, plus tv to focus on while you wait in between tests ( you become very dry mouthed when in a stressful situation like this) as no time to go to get one. Whilst this is an anxious time the staff do their utmost to keep spirits high.",0
185146,"Some time ago my father was taken here and was put on a ward which led near to a morgue as I walked towards it. My father was once Royal Navy and fought for England in the Korean war but had COPD at the time he was admitted. I was told that he would probably not come out because he had blood poisoning but the matron was very unfriendly to my mother telling her not to sit on his bed because of the transfer of germs but no chair was offered to her despite she is poorly and not able to stand well. The Doctors were nice although they played G-d by telling me they would let my dad die if his heart stopped beating without giving a choice to those whose life was in their hands. The next day no one told us or phoned us to tell us that my dad had become very unwell. When I came to the ward later he was breathing harsh;y and was not responsive. It was bitterly cold in the ward as the windows were wide open and another elderly man was clearly very cold. I asked the nurses to shut them but they took their time and were cold towards me. No one told me my dad was dying, and I watched as he stoppped breathing. My mother arrived and no one said anything, just that he was dead. Everyone acted as if a human being had not died here but rather someone who was nothing, except they could not understand the felings of those who are left to know that he was very much human and was a brave man who fought for our country. Nurses have forgotten to care it seems and suddenly all that Nightingale hoped to acheive has died and all that remains is the suffering of humans who should be treated with true compassion.",1

The nurses do not show any compassion or care towards the elderly and on several occasions other elderly patient's asked for help and the nurses just walked past and complete blanked them, its only when my mom said it was disgusting that a domestic asked her if she was okay, also elderly patients was given food who needed assistance on 2 occasions my sister who works in a care home assisted with feeding patients as staff left them to go cold and walked off, There is no care shown towards the elderly and I feel patients and relatives are treated disgusting and if they do not want to show care they are in the wrong profession, From what I saw and heard on this ward it concerns me for patients who have no visitor's thank god my nan has a carer and fingers crossed no one I know will be admitted to this ward. The nurses I came across should be a shamed.",1

The department appears highly organised and I felt that the service provided to myself and others attending was very friendly,professional and efficient. In under 90 minutes all the checks and final consultation were complete. As someone in the health service myself it was clear to me that this is a very efficient and well thought out department. I am happy to highly commend the staff in this department, and the service it provides.",0

There he was treated immediately with intra venous antibiotics and they gave him double the dose of oral antibiotics to what Weston had given him. If not treated so swiftly and properly this could have become a life threatening condition on a 21year old, it doesn't bear thinking about. Thank you so very very much Southmead.",1

Fortunately his medical and nursing care at Southampton General Hospital was exemplary and we are grateful for it. After six weeks in Southampton Ian was transferred to Southmead Hospital Bristol. He has remained there for another eight weeks. Again his medical, ancillary and nursing care has been exemplary. Both our son and his parents were treated professionally with due care and attention. We found staff to be alert to our son's needs at all times. Thank you Gate 9B.",0
186232,"Recently took my 14 month old daughter who had fallen over and was hysterical. I advised that she hit her face and that it seemed she was really struggling with her arm. Firstly the nurse stated to me that she just sounded tired and not in any pain. I know my daughter and knew she wasn't right. Then I was made to feel awful because I had not given her any calpol. Even though she was that upset I couldn't get any down her.. But the reason why I am incredibly angry is because even though I told the doctor she had hurt her arm, they wouldn't even look at it. Because she was able to move it when she was walking round they told me it definitely wasn't broken. I go home having all my faith in the dr however it was obvious that she was struggling. She wouldn't hold anything with it or put any pressure on it. On Monday I took her to Grantham A & E who were wonderful and discovered my little girl had fractured her arm and has had to have it plastered. So Newark hospital left my 14month old daughter with a broken arm for 4 days ! It is a minor injuries unit who are supposed to deal with breakages but clearly this is not the case!!",1

Yesterday I returned for a six weekly review at the fracture clinic. I was called into the plaster room six minutes earlier than my appointment time and what followed was a seamless flow through via X-ray, doctor and back to the plaster room to have a boot fitted. Entire visit took just over an hour with a maximum of 10 minutes waiting time between stages. The staff were friendly, kind, approachable and put me at my ease. This was a very positive experience and I am sure will have a positive effect on my recovery . Well done to all and it gives me much pleasure to be able to respond with a positive review.",0

The machine would not take a note and we struggled to get together £10 in change. If there is a department that administers parking fees, could you pass it on, please? Thank you.",0
186748,"My 84 year old mother suffers from Alzheimers. She was admitted to Scunthorpe hospital after she accidentally took an overdose of her medication. The medication slowed her heart down. She was moved from CDU (where the staff were really helpful and brilliant) to the Coronary Heart Unit. My brother, his wife and I visited mum tonight. We were mortified to find mum laying on her bed with her dossette box, complete with tablets, inches away from her. I went to the nurses desk and asked if they knew that mum had taken an overdose. They replied 'Yes'. I told them her medication was on top of her cupboard. A nurse immediately came and put it in the lock up box. I told her I was shocked. This was a very dangerous situation. There was nothing to stop mum taking the remaining tablets. Where has common sense gone on this ward? Mum was alone in the bay when we arrived, there were no other patients in. She was crying her heart out. I haven't seen her cry for over a year when my aunty died. For most of our visit, we heard staff chatting about their personal lives.

186771,"My wife took my 16 month old son to the A&E when he walking with a limp. He was given some paracetamol and ibuprofen because they suspected it could be a strain in his knee. A couple of days later my little one had a sore knee and couldn't stand on his left leg at all. He went back to crawling but this time round he was dragging his left leg behind him while crawling. I realised the medication we were given earlier wasn't working so I took him back to the hospital again. I became very annoyed when a doctor asked me how I know it's my son's knee that was hurting (eventhough his knee was so sore). Anyway an x-ray was done on the whole leg from hip down and nothing at all showed. The doctor asked me to still continue giving him paracetamol and it will get better. I'm no medical expet but I knew they were missing a blood test as there was nothing at all showing. Couple of days later, I drove all the way into London to St Thomas Hospital where my son was born. Another x-ray was done and a blood test was carried out straight away. The blood test showed that he had an infection. They put him on antibiotics straight away and have scheduled an MRI scan. I wonder what would have happend to my son if I had just given him paracetamol in the hope that he will start getting better eventually. For me that's it with Darent Valley!",1

187498,It was surprisingly quick getting angio CT scan arranged and all the medical staff I encountered here and in Brighton were exceptionally kind and helpful. But 4 weeks after the scan took place - my GP still didn't have results. I got different and internally inconsistent stories from the hospital admin about the official readiness status of the results letter to the GP over a 3 week period of chasing on the phone. Although every time - the person II spoke to did their best to be helpful. Looking back on this I think the admin staff (at hospital and GP interface) are having to spend too much time dealing with the paper transmission of documents and related lost information queries (from patients like me) due to having to work with inadequate investment in data infrastructure. They do the best they can - but the IT mechanisms they have to use are not fit for purpose. And it seems to me that the dating of documents (for stats tracking purposes) doesn't necessarily correspomd to externally actionable physical reality.,0

Because the service closes at 12pm, unless you go at 6 or 7 am in the morning and wait for them to open at 8. 30 / 9. 00 am you have to wait. The problem is that there's no place to wait either. There are a few steel chairs in a corridor which is ok if you're young. If you wait in the car you lose your place in the queue.

After a chest x Ray my daughter was informed it was her asthma and was told she was too young to have anything seriously wrong with her! It appears age is a barrier to illness or disease. The nurse, who was rude throughout this whole visit took her blood pressure by leaving the cuff on and disappearing. The cuff kept reinflating and after 4 times my daughter's hand went blue and she lost feeling in it. My daughter did not feel it at all when her arterial blood was taken which normally is a painful procedure. She had problems with numbness for some time afterwards.

My dad was extremely weak and unable to look after himself. Thankfully, my mother and sisters were able to look after him and get done what was needed but they were not there when he was first admitted or overnight and they had to continually ask/chase/question-it was family who had to alert staff that dads drip had not been reattached. It was family who had to hunt down blankets, it was family who had to repeatedly ask for help on dad's behalf for help with the toilet.

189123,"My son had a 50mile-an-hour motorbike accident, he had his clothes cut off at the scene, was head and body braced and transported to Derriford hospital. My daughter rushed to A&E as myself and his dad were on holiday abroad. When she arrived and saw him he was lying naked under a very small piece of blanket still in the braces waiting for results of scans/x-rays, my son was confused as he had been knocked unconscious and in a lot of pain, my daughter was very frightened and the nurse just kept saying he's ok, even though he was calling out in pain. He kept asking for a tissue as his face was very swollen and his eye was watering, no one took any notice of him. My daughter asked the nurse and she just said there is one over there (the other side of the room). My daughter wiped his face, she then asked for a blanket as he was shivering with shock and cold, again she was told to get it herself. Eventually my daughter was angry about the nurses blaze comments that he was fine and told her that he evidently wasn't fine. The nurse then became a little more caring and made conversation. During this time a doctor (female) came in and lifted my sons blanket to look at his lacerated groin, she did not speak to my son or spare his dignity in front of his sister. The nurse did say this is his sister and she didn't want to see him naked. The doctor still didn't say anything and just dropped the blanket down again. At no time did anyone offer to get him into a hospital gown, eventually his friend arrived and put socks on for him as he was freezing cold and dressed him in hospital clothing which he had to ask for. Later my son asked for the toilet and was told to go himself, he staggered to the toilet (he had a severely swollen ankle and broken wrist as well as sutures and swelling in his groin and facial swelling and bruising all over his body) where he vomited and had to stagger back to his bed. The next day he was told he could go, no one asked him if he was being picked up or if he had any money on him (his sister was picking him up but he didn't have his wallet with him). He then had to ask how to get out and proceeded to hop/hobble with a bag over his shoulder to the main entrance. I cannot believe that both him and his sister/friends were treated with such a lack of care, kindness or empathy. I acknowledge that the staff in A&E see horrific injuries all the time but to patients and their families any injuries are traumatic! especially when you don't know the extent of the injuries at the time and are frightened and in pain. I am very sad and angry that my son, daughter and his friends had to experience this at a very traumatic time when they should have been treated with care and compassion. I work for the NHS myself and repeatedly hear these kind of stories, it is just not good enough. Also my son was told at fracture clinic to leave his cast on for 4 weeks and then to cut it off himself with scissors, when he saw his GP she was horrified and said he must go back to the fracture clinic!",1

This has now been cancelled because the consultant will be on holiday (the cancellation came a week after the appointment was confirmed!) and pre-Op rebooked for the middle of November (so approx. 25 weeks).

My wrist was punctured a total of 6 times, 2 of which were rather deep, the worst exposing a large blood vessel. Care given: first I went to Gainsborough hospital but after having the affected area cleaned was asked to go instead to Lincoln hospital as she believed that tendons may have been damaged. Thankfully they made Lincoln hospital aware of my situation. Once I arrived at Lincoln I didn't have to wait long. Strangely I was denied my x Ray and tetanus booster that the doctor recommended, as the nurse noticed I still had 2 and a half months before it was due.

189871,"My father was transported by ambulance to Colchester General having become unresponsive. When we arrived at hospital the two nurses who were supposed to move him said they couldn't due to one of them having a bad back. I had to do this myself. My father suffered from dementia so I had to explain everything to them. We waited for three hours before a doctor examined him. I explained what had happened and what medication he was on again. The doctor was very uncommunicative and simply left after a cursory examination. Some time later a porter came to take him to the EAU. On arriving I had to explain everything once again, including that my father took warfarin (an anticoagulant) and that without this he could suffer another stroke. I asked when he would be seen by a doctor and was told ""around 9.00am"". He had been taken into hospital at 8.00pm. I left the hospital at about 3.00am in a state of utter despondency. I went back the next morning and my father was awake and the hospital was about to discharge him. He became unresponsive again and the hospital porter who was taking him from the EAU refused to saying that ""there's something wrong with him"". I asked if he had been given his medication and no-body could answer. I was then told that he couldn't be given any medication as it was unsafe as he was ""sleepy"". I asked what was causing this ""sleepiness"" as he kept becoming unconscious and was told that it ""may be the oxygen"". I said again that without his anticoagulant there would be clotting in his blood but was ignored. He was transferred to a ward and I was contacted soon after to be told that his condition had significantly worsened. When I arrived he was naked, having pulled his pyjamas off and I had to re dress him. When I asked what had happened I was told that he had had ""a massive insult to the liver"". When I asked what that meant I was told that it could be a blood clot which had cut the supply of blood to the liver. At this point it was made clear that my father would be put on the Liverpool pathway and I stayed with him until he died. It was only later that I though about the appalling care he had received apart from that which he received whilst dying. I phoned PALS at Colchester to ask about the specifics which had led to my father's liver problem and was told that someone would get back to me. No one ever did.",1

Her parents were treated with dignity and compassion and staff explained the reason for Her condition (a childhood infection) and were reassured that they did the right thing rushing her to hospital. Baby was admitted to the paediatric ward where she was stablised and appropriately medicalised. Due to the kind doctors and nurses attentive action,baby was allowed home after a couple of hours of observation with ongoing medication. Thank you all so much - to staff in A&E, resus, and all in the Paediatruc dept. A very grateful and relieved grandmother.",0
191272,"I was mis diagnosed at the NNUH with rheumatoid arthritis, and given the aggressive drugs that treat it. Thankfully my drug intolerance and needle phobia prevented me taking enough to cause damage. I was then again misdiagnosed with hypermobility and told my symptoms were in my mind pretty much. They wouldn't give me a second opinion so I went to another hospital and 2 years later I've been correctly diagnosed with M. E, EDS type 3, PTSD and depression. My mum died from EDS complications I can now be monitored properly my heart scan was delayed 2 yrs due to all this. I made a complaint. I felt like it was a complete whitewash and nothing was done.",1
191379,"My grandad was admitted to this ward 4 weeks ago. I am horrified at the state of the ward and the smell. I appreciate that the nurses are busy, however due to infection control I think it's disgusting that my grandad was left sitting in a pool of his own urine as his catheter had leaked all over . When informing a nurse who was on the ward he simply claimed that he was 'to busy' to clean up the mess, so I ended up doing this myself. As all nurses must provide an holistic approach I do not think its acceptable that my grandad was left feeling like his dignity had been lost due to this situation. I hope problems like this do not arise for others in the future as my grandad was devastated by this situation.",1
191506,"Following the last review about their experiences, I thought it only fair to leave another review to eliviate fears for future patients... Waiting time was less than 1 hour but no more than expected, staff very friendly and helpful, and the procedure itself was clearly explained, lasted for about 20 minutes and for myself was no more than a little discomfort. You can watch the cctv, should you wish! And would recommend choosing the Gas & Air as you can use this yourself if and when you need to during the procedure, but leaves no lasting effects afterwards, should you need to continue with your work, drive or drink. Afterwards, you are asked to wait approx 20-30 minutes on your bed to compose yourself before leaving, and was offered a drink and biscuits.",0

The staff in A&E Resus were lovely to my mum then I was taken up into Intensive Care Unit where I was in a coma for 6 days, then spent a night or 2 in HDU and then a week on Cringleford Ward, all staff were absolutely amazing and thankyou for saving my life with Bacterial Meningitis! : )",0
192358,Treated on ward which made me feel I was taking up their bed rather then to be treated and diagnosed whilst in pain and struggling to breath. Had to argue my stay to be diagnosed rather then placed back in community whilst still sick. Some of the doctors are very caring whilst one encounter with a doctor who seemed keen to discharge me. Having argued my stay with a temperature I was diagnosed later that evening diagnosed with pneumonia and needed oxygen over night. I was then taken seriously and treated appropriately but still discharged quite quickly for community staff to take over my care. It wasn't a pleasant stay battling with medical staff to help me the stress was unnecessary and I was discharged at 10 pm with the wrong medical notes and medication.,1

The sister in charge and the nurse were absolutely marvellous. he was so rude and aggressive towards them but they treated him with the utmost respect. Southend Hospital should be very proud of their doctors and nurses that work in the Eye ward.

All patients on the ward have nappies because the nurses are to lazy to help the poor chaps go to the toilet. Now the physio team refuse to treat him and will send him home unable to walk even though he could a week and a half ago. Disgusting. Don't ever go to this useless hospital,1

None had been administered to him. One of these medications was to prevent fitting. During the night of 6th/7th he suffered a grand mal seizure as he slept. Thankfully, he came through it OK. Also, as a rhenal patient, insufficient care was taken to ensure he was kept adequately hydrated. He was not given a drip in A&E and his son was obliged to go ask a doctor for a glass of water for him.",1

Finally saw a rude, abrupt nurse practioner, who told us, rather smugly, that my son was fine, had no fracture to his misshapen, very swollen arm & we should go home! By Sunday, he was still in agony, so we visited Liverpool Royal a & e. He was triaged, xrayed & seen by a doctor within 2 hours- to be told he had fractured his arm!

193756,"The recently advised reasons for Sussex Community Trust changing Horsham's Phlebotomy service to a 'walk-in service' (or waiting service is a better name) do seem to amount to a lot of 'Flannel': - If the 'number of patients is increasing' surely that means the opening times need to be lengthened and really has nothing to do with transferring reception staff and changing to a walk-in system! Yes: Maybe the walk-in services has been successfully at East Surrey Hospital and Crawley Hospital for over 20 years - but they both stay open until 4: 45 (not 11: 45! ! ) Regarding the assertion that the new service is popular - seems to contradict what I've heard in the waiting area - and contradicts the other point of the Trusts notion that increased attendance and long waits, are agreed as being unacceptable. The reply that Horsham Hospital Management use the rooms for other services in the afternoon, which is why the Phlebotomy currently closes at 12pm - seems to be an admission of lack of - or under-provision of service in Horsham. (but that's hardly a new story) As an INR patient, making an appointment for your regular blood test was very convenient and the loss of this facility and the volume of patients now attending has made your experience very unsatisfactory.......Hooray....So why can't all us INR patients have access to a self test facility and probably help relieve a bit of the pressure on the department?",0

196857,"My mother was transferred to ward 24 of Glenfield from Royal Derby Hospital in Sept 2011 and already deeply distressed she received treatment that was quite honestly diabolical. The ward staff with one exception (an HCA) were uncooperative, insensitive and down right rude. One example of their 'care' was when she rang her bell in the early hours to request an escort to the toilet as she'd been told she must do; the bell was ringing and ignored for almost half an hour until she was so desperate she had to go by herself. Realising she did not have the strength to return to bed alone she rang the bell again. Eventually after another 15 minute wait someone came and preceded to wake all the other patients up whilst shouting at my mother saying she was a mad woman for not waiting for them to escort to the toilet and back or was she just too thick to remember what they had told her. This came after the 4 day delay in receiving the cardiac implant she' was due to have but before she discharged before she was discharged without any information about her implant and with no relevant details of the new medication she'd been prescribed. It also took a month to have the opportunity to ask someone (an implant technician) why my mother kept passing out.",1
197048,I recently attended hospital after having contractions at 32 weeks pregnant. I was in a lot of pain an had a water infection. The maternity ward sent me home when I was in agony along my back an my stomach saying I had constipation. The staff on the ward found it amusing I couldn't go to the toilet an were laughing about it. I was rolling around the floor in agony so went back in. At this point I lost the ability to empty my bladder. Told the midwifes I was dying an pain wasn't just contractions. Eventually they sent me for c section as blood was in my catheter an baby very distressed. Turned out I had a ruptured uterus an they had missed all the symptoms. Lost 3 an half pints of blood an nearly died. The first thing they said to my partner after the surgery was 'that woman in there is not to hav any more children'. After care was also not up to standard. Forgetting to give me anti biotics an failing to see me for 40 hours about expressing milk for my premature baby. Disgusting an left emotionally an physically scarred for life.,1

The second doctor told us that we were lucky that they even checked his urine because of he had seen us first he wouldn't have even nothered(this was apparently the A&E registrar). At no point was he seen by a paed doctor. He continued to get worse over the next day so we had to take him to a private Hosp where he was diagnosed with a chest infection. He improved within 24 hrs and was a different child. The worst and most appalling care ever sling with bad attitudes.,1

198284,"Exemplary care in the Cardiac Care Unit (Ward 32) over the weekend of December 13-14 2014: Faultlessly compassionate and calmly professional nursing staff, in particular the nurse managers; and excellent and considerate clinical leadership and communication from the consultants/registrars. Particular standouts were: - the nurse-in-charge of Ward 32 on Sunday afternoon (14 Dec 2014) : a brilliant mix of going many extra miles on consideration and compassion on top of a foundation of hugely impressive calm, positive professional confidence and authority, and - the Renal doctor who gave us continuity through into Critical Care: excellent communication of clinical issues and consideration of our wishes. I've been surprised to see the poor CQC report subsequently. All our experiences from A&E through Resus, Cardiac Care (Ward 32) and Critical Care have been outstanding. Given the personal circumstances, it's hard to imagine how the experience could have been (even) better, other than (as ever), higher nursing-staff-compliments in departments would make their lives less stressful. Despite it being a weekend, there was no indication of pressures or lack of clinical or support services cover.",0
198363,"Had an appointment at the dermatology department today. Very full waiting area but appointment was on time. Saw Dr Carras. Excellent manner. Answered all my questions. Wonderful service. I tried to compete a questionnaire on the LRI website but the drop down menu asking for the name of the consultant was not operating and the site would not allow me to complete the survey. When I clicked the ""contact us"" tab it said the page was unavailable. It is difficult to give good feedback when the website operates so poorly.",0
198512,"1. What was good about this clinic? a. All the staff were very friendly and there was an apparent great clinical leadership 2. What could work better for you? a. Continuity of clinicians care. The possibility of a patient to return whilst waiting to learn from others 3. Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits (apart from the diabetes going away? ) a. Commodities to improvement patient information within the group 4. How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice between clinic visits? a. Easy contacted via email, very impressive 5.

198514,1. What was good about this clinic? a. Having moved to Ireland I would give this clinic 10/10 for this clinic for everything from reception through to the care. Great team full of staff who know their stuff 2. What could work better for you? a. Telephone support 3. Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits (apart from the diabetes going away? ) a. On line training for apple mac users would be helpful 4. How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice between clinic visits? a. Its good yet the team seem overloaded with work and another support method could be investigated 5. What sort of contact would you prefer between visits? a. Face time or skype because I travel a lot which makes things a little more difficult,0

198638,"My beloved father was rushed to A&E by ambulance after having a seizure at home, the paramedics forced him into the ambulance before he had finished his seizure which caused him immense distress. Once at hospital he was forced to wait in a corridor, again feeling frightened and confused, when he was seen the Doctor didn't introduce himself (I learnt his name from a porter). The Doctors openly admitted that they knew very little about my fathers brain tumour, we requested that they speak to his specialist in Hull and oncology at Castle Hill. Eventually this was done, and he was moved to an assessment ward. Sadly things did not improve there, one Doctor was lovely and again admitted this was out of his remit (which was understandable as he explained it carefully). He also told us to push for answers when on another ward. My father stayed for four days, he was taken for an MRI while we were there but the next day a different Doctor told my father he hadn't had an MRI and implied that my father didn't know what an MRI was. The hospital had no record of it according to the Doctor. Later in the day they found the MRI. At no point did anyone say sorry to my family for this mistake. By day 2 my father was becoming increasingly upset by his treatment. Not one single staff member sat and explained why he was there, as is often the case with seizures my father had forgotten why he was there. Ten minutes of a member of staffs time to explain what had happened would have been brilliant. Instead he rang home very distressed at 10pm and we explained the situation. My father became agitated as to why he was there and security was called. They manhandled him to the ground and sat on him! If the staff had explained to him what was going on he would have understood, instead they bullied, humiliated and degraded a man who only a few months previous had had brain surgery. Where was the duty of care?! The nursing staff where on the whole ok, the nurse in A&E was very kind. The Doctors were frankly appalling with the exception of one doctor. Quite simply, avoid been taken here at all costs, it may be your life you lose.",1

198916,"I went to City hospital on Mon 15th at 8pm with a compound fracture to my wrist and was literally howling with pain, was seen immediately and cared for in resuscitation area - care and treatment was excellent particularly by a young nurse. After this all care went downhill, I was in an emergency waiting area until 4am waiting for a transfer to Sandwell and was left crying in agony after being fobbed off. After arrival at Sandwell and some lovely initial care, I went for surgery then again faced frustration and pain after repeated requests for pain relief were ignored or I was told I had had enough, I threatened to make formal complaint - drugs suddenly appeared, so frustrated to find out from my surgeon I was prescribed hourly pain relief if I needed it! While a few nursing staff were caring and worked hard, many nursing staff were uncaring, abrupt and impatient, elderly patients left for long periods despite asking for help, deaf patient persitantly shouted at - like a louder voice aids deafness? Nursing staff arguing loudly with each other, young helpers laughing loudly and playing jokes on each other - appalling lack of professionalism and care.",1
199078,"My mother who was terminally ill was admitted to A&E 6 times in 7 weeks. Apart from one visit which was up to standard the other 5 occassions were distressing to say the least. A couple of the nurses were downright nasty if we tried to speak to them about my Mother. One team leader nurse reduced my daughter to tears with her insensitive remarks. One nurse gave me a filthy look up and down when I asked if she could help us get my Mum off the commode - she then walked away as if it was beneath her dignity to help this dying woman. The place was filthy, blood smeared wipes had been left on the floor along with packets of butter! I am utterly ashamed to say I work for the NHS myself! (In a different hospital)I would never treat any of my patients with such horrendous lack of respect. I have to say that when we did see a doctor they were amazing but too little too late. The doctors deserve credit in choosing to work with staff who let them down",1

I was immediately impressed with the layout and general feeling of a friendly open space. I had to ask at each point of contact for directions and each time I was given clear and polite advice on where I needed to go. The build quality and finish of the new facility is faultless. I have over The last 35 years attended this hospital for various reasons and the staff have always been very professional and also very caring in their work. Well done Southmead and all the staff that work there in a very difficult and highly critical role. The work that they have done for me personally is nothing short of a miracle. I was nearly unable to walk and work, but after having both of my hips replaced I am now a mountain and ski guide and live a full life Thanks to everyone in this facility. Many Thanks indeed to you all. Anthony Dyte",0
199240,"It was my assumption that rheumatologist were specialist regarding the medicine behind MSK issues yet the ""professor"" there could not even properly diagnose hypermobility, ignored osteoarthritis in my scan results, failed to even noticed my deformed posture or winged scapula's, and have been telling me my arthralgia is fibromyalgia for over 4 years leaving me with undiagnosed and untreated bursitis, tendonitis, impingement, effusions and fractures whilst telling me I was ""borderline"" hypermobile then discharging me. When I attempted to question them I was fobbed off, not even being offered physiotherapy for my extremely unstable joints that pop in and out of joint. No beighton or Brighton test was performed prior to my diagnoses four years ago! When I attempted to complain I was fobbed off by the service manager. All in all I am terribly concerned at the level of service at this hospital. If you have long term, disabling joint pain go elsewhere.",1

From the paramedics who brought her in to the receptionist dealing with relatives like me unable to be with her because of the norovirus outbreak, acting as a go between to keep her reassured - brilliant. My father died 2 years ago at age 96 and in his last few years we leaned heavily on the emergency services as he fell etc. in common with the frailty of age. The staff were all consistently excellent and so I just wanted to say thank you from me - an only child (and an OAP myself!)",0
199518,"My wife was in intensive care from 15/12/14 to 26/12/14. Whilst still in intensive care and on ventilator/ life support the doctor whose name I will not disclose yet for legal reasons decided that she should be moved to another hospital because they had only four nurses on duty when there should be five. He stated another patient could not be moved because I quote ""he is almost recovered so we shouldn't move him"" the fact the mans son was a litigation solicitor and tthe fact my wife was not almost recovered played no part in the decision, nor that she had had a heart attack because of anxiety due to lack of ability to breath through virus and infection . When voicing our concerns nothing was taken on board and the wards sister even accused my daughter of abusing her, which she did not. It was a fiasco and joke which could lead to further heart attack, it had taken ten days to reduce sedation on my wife which they wanted to do, yet on transferring were more than ready to increase sedation. Your life in their hands be it",1
199537,"I am really sad that this hospital even exists. Compared to Saint Georges Hospital in Tooting, Croydon University hospital is an absolute joke. My father has been treated with such disregard in this hospital. 3 years ago we went to the Cardiology dept in this hospital and even after making my father wear a 24 hour heart monitor, the consultants still could not figure out whether my dad had any issues with his heart. They talked him against having an angiogram and a year later my father suffered a massive heart attack and luckily for us he was taken to Saint Georges hospital who performed an angiogram immediately and also told us that my father had at least 4 blocked arteries in his heart. A year ago we were forced to come to this hospital for my father's rehabilitation programme at the Cardiac rehab clinic. It was a nightmare. They asked me to leave the room during the excercize session, didn't read any of my farher's notes. An hour later, I was horrified to discover that my father was left unattended and fell in tbe excercize class. Not only that, my father was also made to carry on with tbe excercize after having hit his head. Noone called me from the waiting area , neither did anyone call a doctor at the scene. I complained to PALS who did nothing at all. A horrible hospital! Disgusted!!!",1

The staff at the breast clinic were friendly, reassuring and professional. The unit is very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere. A follow up appointment was made there and then for 2 weeks time. All in all a very professional service in a pleasent environment. Only downside to Wycombe hospital is the parking. I would recommend parking in the EDEN Centre and walking to the hospital. Much easier. Thank you",0

199706,Uncle admitted to medical ward with blocked catheter. Uncle crying out in pain and collapsed on toilet unable to move buzzed for help nurse not responding.. Niece eventually shouted for help and someone assisted. Asked to see a doctor and was told that he could be waiting 6 hours to see one. Said that they wouldn't leave an animal in so much pain let alone a person. Had to tell staff to change catheter which was eventually done. Told staff that catheter keeps blocking and needed to be regularly checked. Rang hospital next morning to be told uncle had a peaceful night. Got a distraught call from neighbours who were visiting hospital next day to say that uncle was in agony again and no one helping him. Uncle got on phone pleading for help saying that he had been in agony throughout the night and no one had come to help him. After I told staff that I was making a formal complaint and going to papers with this they promptly changed attitude and moved him to aappropiate ward. Was told blood pressure was high then found out that was because they'd forgotten to give him his blood pressure tablet. Now looking for his community nurse notes.,1

200060,"On Christmas evening my 9 months daughter became very ill and after ringing my gp was sent to the urgent care centre (previously clover unit) she was seen very quickly because she had triggered a red warning. After being seen by a charge nurse we were taken round to A&E where we were promptly taken to a cubicle to wait to see a doctor. The nursing staff couldn't have done more to keep us informed and comfortable whilst waiting for the registrar for paediatrics. After a while my daughter was transferred to the children's unit where We were both able to get some sleep. I was woken in the morning by the paediatric registrar who had kindly informed me that she had come to see us a couple of hours before but both myself and my daughter had fallen asleep and she had been told by the A&E staff how tired we had both been so had felt she should let us get some sleep. The sister and a student on children's unit were amazing on Boxing Day morning. Any emergency hospital admission is stressful but all staff made myself, my daughter and my mother feel relaxed and informed throughout. Thankfully my daughter was discharged on boxing day with a nasty viral throat infection and bacterial ear infection so we didn't have to spend the rest of our Christmas in hospital.",0
200147,"My dad was admitted for major vascular surgery. Unfortunately, he was fed too soon post operatively and developed bowel problems, a severe chest infection and kidney failure. Whilst in the ITU he was well cared for but each time he was sent back to the surgical unit, his care suffered from surgeons who were simply too busy in theatre but also seemed to lack the knowledge to deal with complex post operative complications. The surgeons also refused to refer my dad to the medics despite pleas from the family just insisting that he was getting better when clearly he still had serious breathing difficulties and sepsis. The nurses were always saying they were too busy and short staffed. They also did not have the time or inclination to deal with the serious concerns the family had. The patient experience team were contacted twice and messages left but as yet they have not contacted us.",1

We objected as he was confused and had slept in his chair on ward 12 and no-one seemed to notice. He was then re-admitted on the 15th December with confusion and was advised he had kidney failure. He was on intensive care for two weeks and the staff on there were brilliant. He was transferred to New Cross on the 23rd Dec to ward C24 no-one explained to us what was going on properly the Doctors spoke to my Dad which I found strange as he was still confused. He has been discharged now but the stay at both hospitals was extremely unsatisfactory. I am pleased he is recovering but why was his condition not sorted sooner. He was on insulin but has now been taken off it?,1
202508,"The NHS Direct feedback system does not work and did not work 2 months ago. In my second visit to Stoke Mandeville for surgery I received excellent pre-op care and successful surgery. However, I have grave concerns regarding the safety, sense and practicality of staffing hours on the General Surgery Ward (Ward 16). Nurses and their auxiliary colleagues work 14 hour shifts so that they can pack a weeks work into 4 days (2 x 14 - one day off - 1 x 14). These staff are responsible for administering drugs, patient care and monitoring. In my view, it is impossible to sustain high standards of care and attention to detail when you are working such long hours.",0

Retry it a few times to see if the same thing happens every time. Sure does (I've had quite a frustrating couple of hours). My wife had the same experience yesterday and last Friday. Try the Imperial Booking line, they'll transfer you to the same number and steps 1-3 will repeat again. Try the main QCCH switchboard number, they transfer you to the same broken system. How can you make someone wait 15 minutes then reach a point where they get cut off and force them to restart the process ad-infinitum for hours?

203212,Hi im just writing of my experience at the paediatric assessment area when I took my daughter aged six who has direct access to be seen by a doctor because she suffers from brittle wheeze which started when she was only six months old.i took my daughter after ringing in to the hospital. She was assessed by a junior doctor who didn't give her a nebuliser despite my child struggling to breathe. I kept on asking for help and the doctor spoke to me with attitude that there are other children who are very poorly who need to be seen.my daughter struggled to breathe in the waiting room for three hours until I demande to see another doctor. The other doctor came and by this time it wss too late for one nebuliser she wss given many back to back nebulizers and had to have an emergency canula because she might need aminophylene.all of this pain and struggle wasn't necessary if she was given treatment straight away,1

As well as these appointments, I also get asked to attend the Medical School/research department to take part in several research projects. The nurses here have always been very welcoming and supportive. The paper work and research hypothesis are always discussed in detail and I receive clear information about what is required. I'm happy to give some of my precious time to help these studies in the hope that things continue to progress for others with diabetes, and indeed for those who don't have it too. The level of care given by all the members of staff in the centre from the front desk as you enter, to the nurse who does your 'wee' (!) weight and quick vision test, to the Retinography screening team, the chiropodists, to the registrars and of course the Consultants/Professors is exemplary (And has been for a long long time) The consultant is the most intelligent and charming person I've ever met and is simply delightful. His passion for research into Diabetes and providing the very best care for all the patients seems to be endless. He clearly motivates and enthuses the wonderful team here. Being such a complicated case (medically and emotionally!) I have complete confidence that the team here provide the very best care (which is also complimented by the Doctors at my GP practice) and am very grateful. Thank you very much.",0

205304,"I want to thank your hospital and staff for the care given to my nephew Paul aged 48. Paul came to A and E in October last and was admitted onto ICCU B9 with respiratory distress due to pneumonia.He had been severely mentally handicapped from a baby and needed 24 hour care as he had daily seizures and could not do anything for himself of communicate. So he arrived with his carers, unable to understand anything and very panicked. He was given a side room in B9 and doctors and nursed endeavoured to treat and care for him as he lay heavily sedated on a ventilator. Paul's care team were allowed to stay with him night and day should he awaken and need a familiar face. Staff had a lot to learn re his history and what could be expected in the way of how he behave and cope with all that was happening. They soon discovered Paul was gentle and brave and his only intention would be to pull every last line or monitor off himself, including the ventilator, and climb out of bed. Paul has has never liked to be touched even by trusted people so all this intense 'intrusion' was torture to him. Yet for 3 months this was his life on B9 and must have been hard for staff to put him through it. No staff ever complained no matter how many times he pulled his nasal feed or trachi vent out. With very careful adjustments to his life support he was eventually weaned off the ventilator having been nursed through several new infections. Sadly he was not able to keep up this progression and became very poorly and died on the ward. So I'd like to thank all staff - doctors, nurses, physios, support technicians and housekeepers for all their hard work in taking care of Paul, who was so vulnerable and disadvantaged. He was never discriminated against for being disabled, uncommunicative and without mental capacity. Unable to co-operate in his own recovery or even accept what was happening made an uphill struggle too much for his damaged body. Bless you all for your tireless efforts. You do an amazing job and long may you continue.",0

We were visited by the Orthopaedic Doctor who did not introduce himself to me or to Alex but just went in full-on saying that his knee was broken and that the best thing was probably to have an operation. My husband is unable to have an operation because he suffers with heart and lung failure. The Doctor failed to see that my husband was in distress as he was told his news about his knee (especially as we had been told previously it wasn't broken). I too was in shock, it had been a difficult day for us both. Basically the Doctor was very insensitive to both of our feelings and I felt we were treated as just another number.",0

I am shocked with how your nurses treat someone who is literally on her death bed. No compassion everyone there was complacent with there job and no one seemed to care about there patients well being. I then walked into the ward yesterday opened the Curtian of my aunties cubical to find her laying there dead,, I nurse rushed over and her first words to be were ""who are you to her"" No one stopped me walking through despite having to press a buzzer to get in.

When she arrived in A&E initially she was seen by a nurse and bloods were taken. She was sent to the GP assessment ward. She waited in total nine hours before being seen by a so called doctor. In all that time no one offered her anything to eat or drink, she was just left. When she inquired about when she might be seen she was told she would have to wait for the doctor who had been delayed. At one point, she became quite distressed and was crying. A nurse asked her why she was crying. She explained that she had been waiting all day to see a doctor, she was in pain and was feeling sick. She was reassured the doctor would be in to see her soon. At 8pm, a nurse asked her how she was, asked if she had been given anything to eat or drink. My daughter said no. The nurse asked if she was nil by mouth. My daughter said she did not think so. The nurse seemed shocked that she had waited so long without any attention whatsoever. She brought my daughter tea and a sandwich and took her blood pressure. When this doctor eventually seen her, she asked why she had been sent to the hospital? My daughter had a referral letter from her GP explaining why!! This female doctor supposedly a consultant examined my doctor, told her she would be referred to a gastric specialist and an endoscopy, would be performed on an outpatient basis. Nine hours, without anything to eat and drink to then be treated in the most off-hand way by a so-called professional obviously devoid of any form of empathy. My daughter's treatment in your hospital has been absolutely scandalous. This is not a complaint about your nursing staff who I am sure are under some considerable stress but your medical staff leave a lot to be desired. Absolutely disgusting service. My daughter left your hospital in even more distress than when she entered it. Shameful is the only word to describe it.",1
206106,"Accompanied my sister-in-law to the gastrology appointment to help her communicate fully. Arrived a few minutes early and was seen exactly on time most professionaly and courteously. A programme of follow-up actions and appointments resulted including immediate blood test, appointment for endoscopy and prescription from pharmacy---all of which were acheived efficiently and with the greatest kindness and understanding. The appointment for the endoscopy test was offered for 3days later and on the day was conducted in an impressive and sensitive manner by all the reception and medical staff. I am not impressed easily, but I would have to say, based on this excellent experience for both of us, that Calow hospital and its staff performed exceptionally for us. In these days of criticism and comment, it gives me great satisfaction to write this positive commentary and to congratulate the staff and management for the high standard of care and positive attitude which we experienced. Well done to all",0
206095,"my husband had a stroke in oct 2013. all the nursing staff in casualty and the stroke ward were brilliant. but the doctors were terrible in casualty,there seemed to be a lack of interest trying to diagnose what was wrong with my husband, and suggested without any examination what so ever that my husband had vertigo, and would prescribe some tablets and send him home . however this would not be possible as he could not walk. it was when the next doctor came on duty, that he discovered that he had had a stroke. since then a few weeks ago my daughter was rushed to casualty with burns. ,and again all the staff were brilliant including the paramedics, but the doctors were extremely rude and uncaring, to the point of the nurses apologising for them. in our opinion these doctors need some lessons in people skills.",1
206344,"From my initial consultation with the Consultant (Rheumatology), in 2012 who put into motion the various tests needed to diagnose the problems I have been experiencing over a number of years. Hip replacement & after care Physio, the service offered by the above & the rest of the staff at MKGH from start to ongoing has been nothing but exemplary. Every member whether it be in catering, physio, nursing to name but a few has shown me courtesy & care. The hospital should be proud of its team & recognised for the difficult & stressful job they are doing.",0
206389,"I was shocked how bad A&E was this Sunday afternoon. We waited over 4 hours and would have waited longer if I hadnt insisted and made a fuss. There were over 10 patients on stretchers in the corridor as there was no room in cubicles and the ambulance staff were having to hang around waiting. No one bothered when I asked twice if my mother could have something to eat, the staff ignored an elderly patient who was shouting for help, the door to the cubicles was left wide open so people waiting in reception could see patients lying there half dressed and people were treated in the corridor. Even the staff seemed exhausted and disinterested in the patients and they said it was chaos constantly moving trollies with patients up and down the corridor. Was told by a doctor there its been like it for months!",0
207004,"In December last year my daughter had a water infection which wasn't clearing as quickly as it normally did and the only way to get her urine tests results quickly was for her to be admitted to hospital so our doctor did this. After being put on the medical investigation unit she was transferred to Ward G2 Royal Oldham hospital. As she was a kidney transplant patient I knew she needed to take her medication the following morning so left her tablets and medicine plus eye drops which had to be kept in a fridge. The next day a consultant phoned to say they were treating her for the infection so I asked if she had had her meds, the answer was no. They had lost them plus the drops had been thrown in a cupboard so had to be destroyed. This was the start of a dreadful 6 days, my daughter didn't even receive basic nursing care. She eventually died a few days later, so I want my story told so as nobody else is treated as she was and our family put through so much heartache",1
206968,"1) What is good about this clinic? a) Friendly staff, competent doctors 2) What could work for you better at this clinic? a) Long waiting times. Very unpredictable when you may finish Very difficult to reschedule an appointment. Availability is very low even months in advance 3) Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits (apart from the diabetes going away)? a) Regular diabetes groups/evening drop downs. Possibility to submit blood sugars on line at intervals 4) How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice in between clinic visits? a) Possible, via email, contacting diabetes nurses 5) What sort of contact would you prefer between visits (if any email/skype/face to face/ telephone) Why is it good? a) Face to face if you can or email 6) Stories a) Clinic was successful in getting for me a pulse monitor.

A holistic view of my other health issues like depression.

206961,"1) What is good about this clinic? a) The staff of doctors 2) What could work for you better at this clinic? a) Appointment managements as appointments are often cancelled/rescheduled & it takes too long to be seen once here 3) Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits (apart from the diabetes going away)? a) Offering newer blood test meters, pumps, equipment 4) How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice in between clinic visits? a) Have not tried 5) What sort of contact would you prefer between visits (if any email/skype/face to face/ telephone) Why is it good? a) Email, more convenient and easy to answer quickly",0
206963,"1) What is good about this clinic? a) The board on the wall that tells you when its your turn and where to go is wonderful. Clinic runs smoothly I. e. bloods, assessment then doctor 2) What could work for you better at this clinic? a) Other hospitals do other blood tests in advance of consultant or doctor appointment, e. g. thyroid, liver, kidneys so you find out the results at your appointment. Here they do theses bloods after appointment so you never know the result. I find that the letter from the hospital often arrive on the day of an appointment or after you have been to hospital which means that you cannot use the self-service check in facility. I think that the landline reminder/confirmation of appointment is good but if you are not in when they call then you do not confirm, can they leave a message and you call them back to confirm? Or use the mobile to ask for confirmation? 3) Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits (apart from the diabetes going away)? a) I think have acess to clinic staff is important if you are having problems with something or need to discuss something e. g. time differences if travelling. 4) How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice in between clinic visits? a) Very easy, I have continued email contact with dieticians who works with me on the pump. She calls me at home sometimes. I guess I would ring nurses telephone number if I needed to. 5) What sort of contact would you prefer between visits (if any email/skype/face to face/ telephone) Why is it good? a) Email is good for me as I can do emails late at night when I have time. Phone calls are good. I sometimes come to see Victoria Francies. The whole combination is good. 6) Stories a) I think the telephone reminder service is good but could be improved as I got text yesterday for today's appointment.

207150,"I have to come to addenbrookes quite frequently due to my illness, to get blood tests etc, and some days I am in the hospital all day. As such I need access to wifi to be able to carry on with my work, as well as passing the time. What I fail to understand in a modern era, is that a high tech hospital like addenbrookes at the fore front of research is unable to provide either free or paid wifi access to its patients and visitors. The upfront infrastructure costs could be out weighed by the additional revenue that could be made through either paying for the service or advertising revenues. I feel that it is unbelievable that you are able to pay for parking but not for wifi, especially as every business relies on internet access. If your internal IT teams are unable to do this cost effectively there are many outside companies that could provide you with a package including maintenance. I feel that addenbrookes is letting its patients and visitors down in the reluctance to move forward into the 21st century. And ultimately a missed revenue stream.",0
207206,"Today I had to visit A&E. My GP referred me for a minor complaint. The service was across the board excellent. The A&E book in was pleasant and efficient, the medical care excellent and the wait time around an hour. The pharmacy were most helpful, the reception staff very good at directing me to find the pharmacy and the volunteer helper great at showing me where to go. And the volunteers who ran the tea shop etc great too. This is the basis for an excellent service. I am most grateful to all who helped my visit. Thank you.",0
207643,"My wife gave birth to our 2nd son via Elective C-section at Whipps Cross (5th Feb 2015) and I wanted to take the opportunity to thank all the staff involved for the superb service they provided before, during & after the procedure. The whole experience was excellent. The facilities (particularly for the birth & in the recovery room) were new and spotless. The Consultant/Anesthetist /the Nurses and the Midwives were reassuring and on-hand throughout, both in terms of care and information, making the procedure a stress-free occasion. The staff on the Mulberry Ward (we were Bed 21) following the Birth continued the high standard, with a high visible presence at all times, superb attentiveness and care throughout my wife & son's stay. A service you should be very proud of. In today's complaints culture my wife and I felt compelled to praise all involved",0
207713,"Arrived early for my 9.20am appointment to beat the morning traffic. Within 5 minutes I was directed to the X-ray department reception. Almost immediately I was taken for my X-ray. Very thorough and each of the 3 X-rays checked. Came back up to the orthopaedic department and again almost immediately saw the registrar who listened to everything I had to say, asked me about my shoulder then very clearly took me through the X-ray results and answered all my questions. Then various treatments were discussed and agreement reached as to the best course of action. A very stress free efficient hospital appointment and all staff were courteous and caring. Thank you Trafford General.",0
207699,I was referred by my GP for an x-ray. I have not been to Leighton Hospital recently but I was very impressed with the new main entrance and particularly the clear colour coded signposting. In attending for an x-ray I simply need to follow the yellow sign posts which were very clear. When I went for my x-ray the staff were very kind and helpful. The radiologist helped me get into a comfortable position as I am having problems with my hip. Well done to all concerned - a very good service.,0
207901,"My experience at Ashford & St Peter's Hospital, in Surrey, was excellent. From parking to finding the department, checking in, the service from the nurses and the consultant was faultless. The cleanliness of the hospital was immaculate, and the knowledge and friendliness of the staff was very good. My son is due to be re-examined next year, and even though I was given a closer location option, I have agreed to return to Ashford & St Peter's Hospital, based on my very positive experience. Well done all at Ashford & St Peter's, keep doing what you are doing.",0

208418,"1 What is good about this clinic? Treatment is better than in local hospital – Medway-Chatham. Atmosphere is better – staff friendlier. 2 What would work better for you at this clinic? Would be ideal if it is closer to my home. Better with app time keeping. 3 Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits? Lived with the diabetes since childhood so the patient feels she has a lot of info about the condition. 4 How easy is it to contact the diabetes team for advice? When trying to contact she only got the answer phone, in an emergency its essential to be able to speak to somebody. Not quick reply either. 5 What sort of contact would you prefer in between visits? Telephone is better than e-mail & will help to deal with the emergency quicker. Original app 10: 30, 12. 33 still waiting to be seen.",0
208419,"1) What is good about this clinic? Continuity of staff. Personal staff – they know my first name. Education – DAFNE course, pump technology options. Cutting edge nature of learning about diabetes from people who know what they are talking about: Prof Amiel, Helen Rogers, Paul Malgus, Sharon Evans 2) What would work better for you at this clinic? Often feels chaotic, so many people in the waiting room. Can sit for 2 hrs, although the last 2 clinics have been fine. 3) Is there anything that could improve the experience of living with diabetes in between clinic visits?

208391,"As I could not get an appointment with our GP early enough for my wife to be seen when she was very unwell I called 111. I was advised there were no ambulances for 4-5 hours, the same when I called 999. In the end I took my wife to the A&E unit at the Queen Elizabeth hospital. At the hospital there were 8/9 ambulances, when I asked about all the ambulances there I was told they all had people who were being treated in the ambulances as the A&E department was so busy My wife was later admitted to the hospital and operated upon for a fused bowel and bladder. Sadly my wife died not being able to cope with the strain of the operation and the other condition she suffered from.",1

208724,"my mother had two stays in pinderfields, the first was for nearly three weeks in ward 43, we found it necessary to complain about the appauling lack of basic care she received, too many incidents to report on suffice to say she was discharged in a worst state of health than when she went in. She was re-admitted a few short weeks later when it was obvious to a visiting nurse she was very ill. My mother was so fearful of ward 43 she and my father refused to have her go there. She was admitted onto the cardio ward on level D. Her basic care was better, that is the only positive thing I cansay. My father never missed a minute of visiting times, often spending in excess of 8 hours there, he is disabled but kept up his vigil because as a family we did not feel confident she would be treated well. My main complaint is the total lack of information we were given, We had to seek every scrap of information about her care and her prospects for recovery. The day before she died after five weeks in hospital a consultant did speak to my father to tell him that she wouldn't get any better, that was the sum total of our end of life care plan. She didn't think to mention that she may die sooner rather than later. At just after 6am on 10th January my father got call to say that my mother had died, he rang me totally distraught. Given my fathers disability we got to the hospital a couple of hours later and was horrified to be shown onto the ward, the curtains were drawn but all around us patients were sat waiting for their breakfast, we were distraught at the state my mother was presented to us, Her mouth was wide open and my father was weeping over my dead mother trying to close her mouth, I asked a nurse how she died and she told me she was checking her fluids and noticed.... she was going to say noticed she was dead. To this day I don't know why my mother died, no-one has spoken to us, she was my mother for 54 years but I feel she was an inconvenience, a bed blocker to this hospital. She was loved and if we had known the end was near we wouldn't have left her that night, a family were allowed to stay all night with their loved one why weren't we given that chance to be with her. This hospital cannot give me what I want, to be with my mother in her final hours, my father was there every visiting hour, but he missed her passing after 60 years together. When did the health profession get so uncaring, I wont be put off from persuing answers, a telephone call from a matron covering the hospitals back will not suffice this time. My mothers name was Sheila.",1

The rest of drs and nurses in paediatrics and rainbow ward was great always polite and professional and treated my daughter well. The initial nurse should be put on a course to learn how to deal with the public / parents in a distressing time. She apologised just b4 we went to the ward probably because she could hear me saying I was going to report her and I still am",0
208851,"I have recently been taken to A&E twice at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Both times I had been drinking. The first time I had delusions that everybody was trying to kill me and it resulting in self harming. The second time I took and overdose and self harmed deeper, and both times I was involuntarily taken to A&E. I have always been too afraid to go to the hospital when I have needed stitches for self harm or when I have attempted suicide because I have heard many stories about people being treated poorly due to the problem being self inflicted, but I wanted to thank the paramedic team, and the hospital staff that treated me as they were very helpful and very kind and caring on both occasions.",0
209008,"Honiton hospital is very poorly run especially for children, after moving from torbay to honiton the standard of care for children is aweful. Children are fobbed off without treatment where gp's in other areas would have given treatment. They missed diagnosing scarlet feaver three times before we took our son to exeter a&e and they diagnosed it after being told by honiton that it was just a cold and to wait it out. Also for conjuntivitis that had spead to both eyes of our other son, after 4 days of our son having both eyes stuck together still no help from honiton hospital. I can list mistakes from honiton hospital as they have been utterly useless and i have never beem so dissapointed with or hack lack of faith in the gp's in a hospital as I have with honiton. I would strongly recommend getting a second opinion for anyone away from honiton.",1
210702,"I was referred to the cardiac risk management service following aortic valve replacement surgery. I am 48 years old and so was a bit uncertain about what benefit I might get as the class would likely be filled with more 'typical' heart patients (ie mostly quite a bit older and less fit then me). However the classes are well-run and personalised to each patient's baseline of fitness, flexibility etc and that meant I was able to exercise in a group with the social benefits that brings but on my own tailored programme which meant I got what I needed for my ongoing recovery. The specialist nurses and physios work really well together as a team, are always positive, helpful and attentive and they create a very supportive and positive atmosphere for the sessions. Thanks!",0
212028,"My mother was admitted in Sandwell Hospital and with sharp pains in her stomach. third day she was sent home with antibiotics and told to rest. Mother took tablets as advised, but started to throw up and ended back at the hospital. Doctors admitted they have made a mistake of sending her home soon. My mother suffers from asthma, and She can speak English if you speak slowly and clearly due to hearing problem. Some nurses were wonderful, and helpful. Gave advise and information when needed. But at other times when duty changed, Mum was not given medicine when requested. She needs her neutralizer and she was not given one for 4 hours. Mother was in Lyndon 2, but once she was in Prior ward, it was worse. Mum being an elder person, was told to do things her self and refuse to come when she pressed buss er for help. She had to wait an hour before anyone turned up. I am really concerned as my mother is still in that ward, and if i complain, they may make it hard for her.",1
212018,"My 100 year old Mum was admitted with a broken arm.Prior to the fall she was mobile,erudite,and cared for herself.Within 2 weeks she was immobile, incontinent, confused and agitated. During her stay she was moved 10 times, either to different wards, different rooms on same wards on even to different floors !! Her dentures were lost, plus 2 pairs of slippers and umpteen nighties. I repeatedly asked why she hadn't initially been admitted to an orthapaedic rehab unit, only to be told they hadn't a bed and when they did have a bed Mum was immobile because she'd been confined to bed/chair and Brownhill wouldn't take her !! I blame the General for that. Sadly, she died just 2 weeks after I'd managed to get her moved to a Care Home, and I was more saddened that her Death Certificate named dementia as a secondary cause. I have heard several similar stories from friends and neighbours regarding the care their elderly relatives endured too. In my opinion Southampton General caused the last months of her life to be extremely sad and miserable.",1
212389,My daughter was discharged from spruce ward today after an 8 day stay. My daughter is only 21 and has had serious neurological problems most of her life she was admitted with a blinding headache and was in agony. As promised on day 2 the pain nurse visited her and reviewed her meds and 48 hours later her headache had greatly improved. Neurology ran some tests also. The staff worked as a team and I new what was going on at all times as well as rebekah. My daughter was treated with kindness and respect as we're all the other patients . The stroke patients were treated with dignity and respect and sometimes I was near to tears see g the compassion shown by the staff. Thank you so very much for helping my daughter get better and for easing the burden of having a very unwell relative,0
212510,"My mother was sent here a few days ago because she was seeing things that are not there and is unwell. Since then the Doctors have excluded me, and although I asked if she can stay in until she is better, they consulted with my brother, who is not a carer, and is discharging her today with no care plan and knowing that she will be alone in an unsafe place. I found nurses and Doctors not attending to patients, walking past me as if I did not exist, not even asking who I was which is a breach of security, and when I tried talking to nurses about my mother they coldly told me they were busy. They left my mother unattended for hours and my father died in this Hospital. It is a vry cold and uncaring Hospital and I would never accept treatment from Doctors. I told them I am no longer going to be a carer if they are letting my mother out before she is better as I cannot take responsibilty when they should be treating her infection and illness. I will contact NHS England",1
212402,My first visit to the BALANCE Clinic was another example of the high standards achieved in our Heart of England hospitals. The reception area was clean and staff friendly and professional. The appointment with Dr Fahmy and his staff Christine and Sarah was on time and a very reassuring experience. Dr Fahmy and staff showed a very caring attitude and a great understanding of the problems I have with balance. I am convinced they will go the extra mile to give me a chance for significant improvement in Balance problem Thank you all at the Balance Clinic for the encouragement and advice you gave me yesterday and I look forward to your future help to try and resolve my balance problem.,0
212965,"My brother who has dementia ended up in the General Hospital F8 ward. His treatment was simply awful. Staff failed to feed him he was not offered adequate drinks. Staff complained about staff shortage and the fact that the mental health nurse employed to care for him was paid more through the agency. The nurses were all lovely when we spoke to them but completely overwhelmed with the patients and their needs, maybe there needs to be more staff. The agency mental health workers were so poor and one female quite aggressive towards him, she told me she understood mental health issues but I doubted that in looking at her reaction to my brother. He was scared, confused, agressive but bed bound so no real threat and in 4 weeks lost over 4 stone. He was eventually sectioned and sent to Gosport. In the 5 days he has been there he has been washed properly, treated with such respect and they have made sue he is eating through protein drinks and drinking plenty. Unfortunately it's probably too late he has just been taken into QA at Portsmouth as he has infections and is very poorly, I think this should have been picked up at Southampton. I have no doubt in the abilities of staff at Southampton but having seen my mother suffer similar indignity I am simply devastated that they still treat people with dementia with such distain. Yes they are a pain and yes they don't do things we normal people do. But they are frightened and alone in a world none of us would ever want to visit.",1

My mother was moved on Saturday afternoon, she herself did not know what was happening and when I eventually found her in Kate Grant Ward at Colchester she was upset and frightened, she didn't know where she was. this lack of communication is appalling - I was shocked to find her bed empty.

The next day we went to see his consultant who diagnosed a bone infection! As a hospital this should of been picked up if he was examend properly he's a 2yr old baby he should of been treated better.,1
213243,"My son is on remand in H. M. P. , Durham. He has suffered with a very painful condition, and saw a specialist at Bishop Aukland Hospital last year. who prescribed him injections to give himself. He has cluster headaches which are likened to labour pains, are called suicide headaches as the pain is so bad. The doctor in prison has made enquiries and did prescribe him the treatment for when the headaches were bad. The prison authorities were told he must have them available at all times. I had a phone call from him yesterday, he was agitated as he had very bad pains, and the injections had run out, and he was suffering badly. I think the prescription should have been renewed and the treatment there for him.",1

The line just rings and rings, there is nothing to let you know that you are in a queue - so if you're trying to ring from a mobile you loose your place anyway as your provder will cut you off after so long. If you get through to the main swithboard, it's the same story - you're put through to the clinic without being told you're in a queue.

215258,"I personally don't find the installation of Costa into the restaurant a very good idea. Firstly, because Costa is expensive with it's drinks and food I am not always able to use the facilities whereas I always stopped for refreshments before. Am sure I am not the only one with this problem. The second problem is the time taken to produce one's drinks. I realise that every drink is made independently and is supposed to be specialist, but when rushing for an appointment and needing a quick tea beforehand, this really isn't possible. Time taken to serve customers is too long for a hospital. The third problem, which is actually rather important (probably vital) is that throughout the whole restaurant there is not one clock. Those people who are waiting for an appointment have no easy quick reference to the time. I had to keep fishing my phone out of my bag to find out the correct time.",0
215325,"I would like to share with people the disgusting way this hospital treats the elderly. After spending 4 weeks on ward 2 it was decided that nothing more could be done for my 89 year old mother, she had been admitted because she had been vomiting blood.My mother suffered from Altzeimers Disease and had been losing weight because she was finding it difficult to swallow. Prior to going into hospital my mother had been put on Forticip protein Drinks and with prompting from the staff at Harmony House she started putting a little bit of weight back on .In the 4 weeks she spent in hospital she lost 12 pounds in weight and weighed just over 5 stone, which i put down to lack of any encouragement for her to eat or drink  On the 19th January 2015 it was decided that she should be discharged, and an ambulance was booked for three o clock, then after I voiced my concerns about her being discharged while she was in such poor health, this was put back to 4 o clock. It was 8-40 that night before an ambulance crew arrived on the ward.I was at the home waiting for my mothers arrival which was not until 9.30,the ambulance crew explained they had other patients to drop off before getting to my mam. i was appalled to see she didnt even have a blanket over to keep out the cold [she only had a nightdress and dressing gown on.] She was absolutely freezing , her legs and hands had turned blue because she was so cold, .the staff and I had to massage her limbs and wrap her in warm blankets. My mam was left shivering and traumatized by this whole incident. How anybody can disturb an 89 year old dying lady who would have been asleep at that time of night and allow her to be driven around on a freezing cold night without a blanket over her is beyond belief.My mother died 7 days after this incident, my mother was treated like a piece of rubbish that had to be disposed of, not with the dignity and respect she deserved .",1
215324,"I can not speak highly enough about the consultant, The Cardiology Operating Team and Medical Staff they were friendly, informative,supportive and very professional in their overall attitude towards myself and everyone on the Unit. The Admin staff were very friendly, made you feel at ease prior to my operations and also throughout the follow up appointments. The Nurses were very professional on the ward and made you feel at ease and were very supportive. The Operating team with the consultant were first class and everyone made you feel comfortable and at ease during your operation and afterwards also provided a very professional attitude towards me , giving me advice, information and support. Everyone made me feel at ease and the dedication shown to me was of an excellent standard. Thank you to everyone at Castle Hill Cardiology Department. Sincere regards Mr Andy Fuller",0

She had to wait for some time for the porter and by the time he came she had been sat in the wheelchair in the corridor for some time. She felt sick and dizzy. When she told the porter how she felt he told her that she was not the only patient in the hospital and that she should have more patience. From that point on she didn't feel like telling anyone in the hospital if she was feeling unwell, she hated every minute of being there.",0

215483,"I could not praise the care my son in law received whilst in ICU at kings but when he was moved to a neurological ward it was down hill all the way, my son in law had a spinal injury and had no movement from neck down so when nursing left his meds on his table what was he expected to do, likewise some of his meals, he was laughed at by a member of staff when he asked for a drink and after we spoke to sister who reassured us they would speak to their staff the following night he was woken at 4.30am for a bed bath, the ward let him down in what was basic care, no one introduced themselves and just assumed they could take blood as and when it suited them even though he had told them he had a needle phobia, he may not have been able to feel it but the stress he was put through was unbelievable, what happened to the caring profession? Fortunately he was transferred to his local hospital whilst he waits for a bed at Stoke Mandeville where he is now getting the care he needs. Also the ward was dirty, his bed table not cleaned daily and debris on the floor around his bed was left for days, shame on you Kings, you did not impress.",1

After 35 minutes he had not received triage let alone treatment or seen a doctor. My partner sat and waited whilst they discussed Eastenders, what they had done over the weekend, how their respective families were not overrun with patients or paperwork. After 35 minutes she went and asked if her father could be discharged as he was now conscious and coherent. The Nurses then jumped into action, making all sorts of excuses, triage was done , by a nurse who had done a 13 hr shift and a Doctor arrived very quickly once summoned. What would the TV / Newspaper headlines be if he had had a heart attack and died whilst the Arrow Park A&E staff chatted about tv programmes?",0

I feel so so let down by lister have had an epidural there when I had my son no problems at all, my procedure was torture had can someone be put through this when they are clearly in pain and in a state the am out of times they hit a nerve is unbelievable and then for the consultant to ask if they were in my spine is beyond a joke, I now have nightmare and because of the poor care my treatment is far from over.

I was seen pretty quickly and given morphine for pain relief as soon as possible. The Doctors in A&E were very patient and explained everything very well. I was admitted to Swinley Ward overnight and told by the consultant the following day the my pain was probably caused by a hiatus hernia and gall stones. I was treated fantastically on the ward particularly by a young student called Paula and a staff nurse called Laura, they were caring and compassionate and treated all the patients with the upmost care and respect. I was allowed home later that day when I felt better and will need to attend outpatients for follow up tests.",0
216134,An elderly gentleman who has been in terrible pain for a long time eventually got an appointment at x ray. He was treated very poorly and has now just been left in limbo. He was given a ultra sound and then told he needed an MRI the next thing he knew was that the man doing the ultra sound disappeared and a nurse came in and told the elderly man to get dressed and go home. He has heard nothing since and is very confused about the whole thing. Meanwhile he is still in terrible pain. I think that whoever dealt with this gentleman should be ashamed of themselves. To treat a decorated veteran in this manner is disgusting. I will be taking this further.,1

His named nurse shows no compassion, no care and no respect for his dignity. He is in reality abandoned in his bed in a ward where his nurse when asked to give assistance shreiks I am too busy. To wait for 3 hours to have his oxygen connected is unacceptable and one wonders what priorities the nurse works by, to be denied oxygen when one is struggling to breath is abuse beyond imagination. When questioned why his IV line and cannula were lying on the floor under his bed nurse hell flew into a rage and frightened me and my dad they then proceeded to speak only in another language to another comrade in arms. My fathers needs a place of safety urgently where he can be nursed with compassion, dignity and respect, we are genuinely concerned for his wellbeing .may God protect him and keep him safe.",1
216768,"My 10yr old daughter was admitted to hospital in October 2014 with what the Dr's said was appendicitis. She was examined by the surgeons who initially said it was and were going to remove them. They then decided it wasn't and they would not operate so discharged her. She was referred to a consultant who treated her for constipation but she was not constipated. The pains 'flare' up although they never recede completely. She has been in and out of hospital since October and each time they have said it isn't appendicitis although three GP's have said it is chronic appendicitis. The pain is in her right lower abdomen and flares when she walks, when in the car go over bumps and if she is jolted. She cannot lay on her right side and sleeps ( whenever she can) sitting up with her legs up. We believe she has 'chronic appendicitis' and are asking, 'why will the surgeons not remove them?

217039,My daughter had to return to A@E last night due to haemorrhaging after tooth extractions due to being on Clopidogrel The care was appalling . One nurse had the audacity to insinuate she'd been drinking My daughter doesn't drink! She was then put in the waiting room in front of other patients with blood pouring from her mouth She was so embarrassed . She was there until 2 am waiting for it to subside. The same nurse then came to ask if they needed them to ring for a taxi as they obviously still thought my daughter had been drinking .This assumption is completely out of order and this nurse needs to be disciplined and my daughter given an apology. I am a recently retired night manager of an NHS trust and my daughter is a nurse We are very responsible people and my daughter never drinks even when she goes out with friends A formal complaint has been given to PALS This nurse treated my daughter with disdain as she had made a completely false assumption leading to a distressful situation for my daughter.They're not fit to be a nurse and needs to be given a written warning. You cannot just make assumptions about patients and then treat them with contempt when you are completely wrong and making a grave error They are a disgrace as was the whole care in the A@E,0

218570,"The standards of care at this hospital in the Maternity services department are second to none. We had our first child at the Great Western in difficult circumstances and have chosen to have our second child here as a result. However during an ad hoc check up during the evening, I noticed that both of the doors to the consulting rooms in the delivery ward were propped open with bins, despite the doors both being clearly labelled 'Fire Door Keep Shut'. I did briefly mention to the nurse that the doors should not be propped open as they are fire doors. At the end of our visit the door was promptly propped open using the bin indicating that this is is routine and regular practice. Fire doors (of the type deployed) provide two hours barrier protection in the event of a fire. They are there for a reason to stop the spread of fire and protect people to enable safe and efficient emergency evacuation. They are usually placed strategically and to prop them open compromises the safe working conditions for patients and staff. It is also against fire regulations and therefore the law. I was able to observe some aspects which might help explain why the doors are being propped open and can outline some recommendations to return the building to a safe operating state.The ventilation system is noisey which is due to close proximity of supply fans to the diffuser - this results in concentrated blasts of treated air may affect the temperature in the room, potentially encouraging people to open the doors, or the windows (as was suggested by the attending nurse). The unit is short staffed, which may encourage the doors to the consulting rooms to be propped open to allow staff to monitor whether the room is occupied and/or needs cleaning between patients (as it did on the occassion we visited). The bins are located in close proximity to the doors, providing a convenient means to prop the door open. Everyone working in the ward seems comfortable with the practice. The adjacent room's door remained propped open, until it was occupied. Three different individuals passed through our room, past the adjacent room. I recommend: 1)Hold a short team brief before each shift for a week, where staff are reminded about the purpose of fire doors and the importance of keeping them closed. Also remind staff that it is everyone's responsibility to close the doors. 2) Move the bins (or other suitable means) away from the doors within the consulting rooms. This will make it more difficult to use them to prop open the doors (people will only do this if it is convenient - make it inconvenient). 3) Designate one member of staff each shift to check the consulting rooms on a regular basis and make sure they are clean for arriving patients to be seen. This will stop the door being left open for monitoring. 4) Investigate the ventilation system to see if it can be re-balanced. This may removing any potential issues from temperature regulation and remove the need to open doors to ventilate.",0

Second of all, the doctor has told my daughter that the pain she is experiencing for the past 8 years was just her imagining it. The doctor has shown disrespect and every second word the doctor was asking if we had understood what they had said. Also , the doctor was not dressed in their uniform and did not even bother to ask my daughter where the pain was, they had just assumed that she was imagining her pain.

218445,"My 82 year old aunt broke her ankle and, having a history of orthopedic problems including a wedge fracture of the spine and an arthritic hip ready for replacement, plus a heart requiring the imminent use of a pacemaker, she was admitted to an orthopaedic ward. She spent just a few hours there before her bed was required and she was dumped onto a gynae ward. She went over 48 hours without seeing a doctor, until her daughter chased one up. She has now been visited by physio's and OTs who seemingly see her as just an old lady with a broken ankle and have no idea of her other problems as they ask her to stand on one leg, or try hopping. The nurses ask why she is taking so much pain relief for a broken ankle, oblivious to her other problems. My poor aunt is getting increasingly distressed, is desperate to come home even if it would mean her being bedbound and she is convinced she is a burden to the staff on the ward. I would like to complain, but having found the complaints site on the web page, they won't look at a complaint until they have the permission of the patient. Nice move Queens, ill treat your patients until they are frightened, distressed and confused then they're too scared to complain and discharge themselves.",1

The other thing is the TV. It is not a very good service it is also very, very expensive. What could be done is have it say £2 per day instead of £14 per week have discount down to say £10 You could also get firms like home cleaners. decorators, garages they pay a weekly fee to offer there services.

219820,"I just wanted to write a thank you to the Doctor in A&E who took my flatmate seriously and treated him like anyone else would have been treated. An ambulance was rang to our house at about midday on a Monday morning for my flatmate who could not look at the light, could not keep anything down, was crying because of the pressure in his head and couldn't move his legs. The paramedics asked him whether he had been drinking at the weekend and because he said yes they immediately assumed that he was ""dehydrated and probably picked up a stomach bug from being run down"". I pointed out that he couldn't look at a light (knowing this was a meningitis symptom) without being sick and was told that this was a sign of dehydration. If my flatmate had been my 50 year old mother would he have been treated with suspected meningitis and rushed to hospital or is it protocol to not rush someone in with 4 symptoms of meningitis just because they don't have a temperature or a rash? After being made to walk to the ambulance whilst crying, made to walk out of the ambulance to a chair whilst at A&E and being written as minor and waiting in a corridor for an hour and a half I am so thankful that we were fortunate to be seen by a doctor who didn't automatically assume that just because we were students his illness was alcohol related. My flatmate fought for his life for 4 days sedated in intensive care and thankfully he has walked away from this with only mild side effects. What i want to make aware to whoever is concerned is that I witnessed the whole thing: I understand I am not the patient making the complaint but I was the one who was conscious throughout the whole ordeal and I am the one who is most appalled that such discrimination happens to students. We are told meningitis is an illness that is about time. Why was my flatmate not treated as an emergency?

Her temperature and blood pressure were taken and she was sent back to the waiting room. Eventually, a doctor advised that she should have an ECG and blood tests. She was then left in a room and approximately 5 and a half hours after admission her wound was washed and glue used to hold it together. A doctor then came who asked her all the questions that the triage nurse had asked and said she needed more glue applying as the wound was still bleeding. The doctor also wanted to take her blood pressure when sat down and stood up. Again another long wait before more glue was applied and then she was told she could leave without having her blood pressure taken. At 3.50am we finally left for a 35 minute drive home.

All too often people are quick to complain or under etimate the value of a service within the NHS so I wanted to write to compliment the hospital, service and staff on a truly excellent, reassuring and preventative quality job.

222629,"Went on Sunday evening with my 7yr old daughter after she injured her leg after falling off a low zip wire. Told it was sprained, go home don't rest it and getting her walking. 24hrs later daughter still in pain and unable to put foot down. Back to minor injuries same nurse reassured my husband just a sprain and keep up pain killers and get her walking on it. He had suggested an X-ray but was told not needed. Yesterday (Thursday) both concerned, A&E Winchester, X-ray severe break to her tibia, would have needed pinning if she was an adult, 6 weeks full plaster....4 days later. Outrageous. Never again.......we should have been told it wasn't a minor injury and sent to A&E straight away.....",1
222738,"I sustained a head injury and was diagnosed with severe concussion. As a result I was confused, unable to communicate and agitated. It was a frightening experience. I was treated promptly and with respect, dignity and compassion by the nursing staff and in particular by a doctor who figured out how afraid I was of lots of people. When I returned 2 days later the staff were again wonderful and treated me with respect and dignity. I have been to other hospitals in the North East, I feel they have much to learn from Darlington who treat people with compassion.",0
222870,"My partner was sent to Warrington Hospital for an emergency brain scan by a GP visiting him at home after complaining of a severe ""cluster headache"" that had lasted for more than 24 hours. We arrived at A&E and sat there for nearly three hours even though we were given a letter and told to get to the hospital within the hour. His left hand peripheral vision had been affected. After three hours he was sent for a CT scan, various tests were done except urine test and at 2am he was put on Ward A6. My partner was severely disorientated and unable to decipher how to hold his phone. He was kept on this ward for three days, we kept being told an MRI scan needed to be undertaken either that or a lumbar puncture procedure to establish whether he had had a mild stroke. By the Thursday evening without having done the MRI or the other procedure he was discharged with no medication. He was still disorientated and when admitted his blood pressure was through the roof. At the most severe level and risk of a stroke. We were given no after care and he was complaining of mild headaches for two weeks. Then two weeks later he was rushed to Whiston Hospital having experienced a mild stroke. Whiston have now given him the correct medication to deal with this type of blood pressure related stroke. Why didn't Warrington prescribe the blood pressure medication two weeks prior to him having the stroke? I am absolutely disgusted. I found the sister on the ward unapproachable and condescending.",1

After 4.3 weeks spent in bed, with no shower, not eating, incontinent of faeces he was assessed as needing no care at home. He was not able to walk, get in and out of a chair or bed without falling, he was confused and had not had any kind of social care assessemnt other than saying he would be alright at home. He was readmitted after 24 hours with blood infection having had three falls at home and not eaten anything. Sent home with 13 different types of medication in boxes which he was unable to take.

At one time early on my monitor showed a tachycardia event starting - within 15 seconds I had 3 cardio nurses, with crash cart, and had treatment. Within another 15 seconds the cardio consultant was also in attendance. mm (Yes, I was counting!) I've been in private hospital for orthopdaedic operations. The care is good - but not anywhere near WGH Cardio. Admittedly the food in private is better, and more choice. But I've never been in cleaner wards. Bed frames cleaned, including thorough cleaning underneath the frames (+ floor, etc). Never seen anything as good in Private Hospitals.",0

I was not that happy about returning to NMH with my Father as our experiance there three years ago left my Father so traumatised he ended up discharging himself from there. On that occasssion i had to deal with the rudest A and E Dr i had ever come accross and nurses in the AMU(?) ward so busy and reluctant to speak to you that on two occassions during my Father's 48 hour stay they either didn't give him his medication or said they did when in fact they hadn't. This time round we couldn't believe it was the same hospital. From the A and E nurses to all the staff in the Ambluatory Care Clinic, (where the nurses and Doctors were brilliant) and the staff in the Anti coagulation Clinic have been fantastic. Well done.",1
224274,The hospital site has multiple access issues which make it almost in accessible for wheelchairs if you are arriving from the local area rather than by bus or car. There are very few drop curbs that make it difficult to move around the site and access from the Ashfield school side is not possible from the direction of Evington. This is due to a complete lack of drop curbs. To manage this people must use the zebra crossing on Broad Avenue then travel a considerable distance to the next set of lights then cross again and make the same distance on the other side of the road adding 15 minutes to the journey - all for the sake of a lack of drop curbs.,0
224254,I can not believe this hospital has still not taught its staff about communication. After 4 years. My Mother died there in 2010. My father is in there today after being discharged after nearly 5 weeks with a crp level of 59.1 (which is a white blood cell count this shows infection). Now he is back in with confusion due to a water infection which caused him to fall on Sunday and fracture his hip. This time he was in A1 when admitted and they moved him to A11 as far as I can tell he said he did not know he was moving. Also the night before they moved him he told a Dr he did know that what was going on in his head was not true. Today when I walked into the ward he was sat like a naughty schoolboy near the nurses station he was so glad to see me he cried. He had had a bad dream where all his family had been in a car crash his great granddaughters included. He was so relived when he saw my daughter because in this dream she was hurt badly. I feel so sorry for the nurses on A11 as they are so short staffed that they are trying to do 101 jobs at the same time. They had no one who could sit with him while he was so distressed because he kept getting out of bed and falling.,1

Firstly the office only work limited hours, even closing at 3pm on a Friday. Why are they not open longer as the car parks are open 24 hours? Secondly don't even think you can pay by debit card, as the machine is non operational and has been for over 9 months, with the vast sums of money they are collecting in parking, why haven't they got the machine repaired?",0

Mum spent a few hours on CDU and was then moved to Invicta ward the staff were brilliant from the doctors to the cleaners we cannot find a bad word to say.

Luckily x-ray department was not busy. I actually saw consultant 1 hour after original appointment time, only to find that they could not access x-ray on computer system. After four failed attempts and two phone calls to x-ray department I was asked to go back to waiting area while the consultant saw someone else, 30 minutes later the nurse went to the x-ray department to obtain a ""hard"" copy.

We then transfered to Solihull and two visits later discovered it was all caused by eye infections.

Sadly on the 15th July 2014 she passed away I still feel anger and still cannot understand why this hospital did not find this .

Explained to Dr. that I was particularly concerned as my younger sister died on Monday from bone cancer, which was very sudden, but her pain symptoms weren't recognised/diagnosed for some time as being so severe and deadly. The doctor understood with much sympathy and after an ECG, blood test and X-ray confirmed I had no serious condition but advised me to take care of myself during such an emotional and stressful time, and take Paracetamol & Ibuprofen unless the symptoms got worse. The doctor's comforting words were also such an incredible help in the healing process, not just physically but in terms of emotions and of understanding my anguish. Please acknowledge this praise after having shared it with them, as I felt so fortunate to have met such a caring young Dr. who was so professional and also very tactful.",0

She was looked after and treated by a wonderful team of doctors and nurses who were very supportive and explained what was happening to my mum as her condition rapidly deteriorated. They were sensitive and kind and I really appreciated them letting me stay with my mum for the two nights before her death. My mother died, very peacefully, on Wednesday April 1st and again the Doctor and other nursing staff were both sensitive and supportive. When I had to leave my mum I felt assured that she would continue to be well looked after I left and be treated with the care and dignity they had all shown her over the last few days of her life. Thank you all for the comfort your care brought me and my family at such a sad time.",0

The waiting room was packed full of sick people and quite a lot of drunk people. An elderly man who'd come in with his wife was hit in the face, spat and swore at by an extremely drunk man. Security walked past numerous times during this disgusting assault and didn't say word! It took other patients to stop the man from going further. I am absolutely disgusted and still quite shaken up. Hospitals are supposed to be safe places but I can honestly say when I was sitting in a&e lsst night I genuinely feared for mine and the other patients safety!

He phoned my step mother to say his leg - which had been operated on previously to increase the blood flow - was painful. When my step mother arrived the today to take him home she alerted staff to the fact his leg was purple - he had already been given morphine for the pain. It was down to the persistence of my step mother that my father ended up in an emergency ambulance to Wythenshawe Hospital and we are now waiting to hear if he will loose his leg.I am absolutely appalled with the care he received at Stepping Hill.,1

At least 50 people went ahead of me although my reason for being there was potentially life threatening. At one point a matron came out and yelled that there were 'really sick people' being treated indicating we were all just a nuisance. Beside me was a boy with a severed finger, a man with a broken arm and a young lad who'd come off his motor bike and had broken toes. The receptionists were unhelpful and rude. They told me they'd kept me waiting 5 1/2 hours because they thought 'I should see a female doctor' although I had not expressed a preference. Thoroughly ghastly experience.",1
227543,Great antenatal Care through out Our baby was born via c section in February this year Due to being breech The postnatal care was so apalling We were left in the post natal ward 4hrs after surgery after coming out of the high dependancy ward. No one was there to help show us how to feed pain meds were forgotten many times over our 36hr stay. We discharged ourselves early due to the horrendous level of care. It was worse than being in a zoo. The noise was deafening 24hrs a day.we didn't get a wink of sleep due to the noise and over crowding The ward was so busy no one knew what was going on I was discharged with no pain meds and our babies blood sample which was taken as he was born to check if our bloods were compatible was contaminated with another babies blood so his results were inconclusive. One of the midwives got my age wrong and gave me anti clotting injections before realising I wasn't high risk and didn't need the injections. And above all the filth of the bathrooms on the postnatal ward was so disgusting with blood everywhere and bins overflowing I can't even describe what a horrible experience the whole 36hrs was,1

228400,"I went in to have a managed miscarriage at 18.5 weeks as my baby's heart had stopped beating. Due to a previous c section they were worrying about my womb rupturing because the tablet they would give me would cause very strong contractions they couldn't control. So the gave me a half dose and then left me to it. If I had been giving birth to a live baby I wouldn't have been left alone to deliver. After 2 hours of excruciating pain and being told that I had all the pain relief allowed, I delivered my baby alone, then when the nurses came they took him and I was left to deliver the placenta. After 3 hours of bleeding they decided I now needed emergency surgery to remove the placenta. This is a totally barbaric and inhumane way to treat a woman who is carrying a dead baby in 2015. Why I wasn't taken to theatre and my baby taken surgically so I didn't go through the pain and suffering that I went through. Why do healthcare staff have inadequate training in miscarriage? Do you gave any idea what it is like, knowing your baby is already dead but you are forced to go through the pain of labour?",1

I phoned up to ask if they'd received the referral - yes, they received it two weeks ago. I then asked when I will receive note of the appointment - I'm told I will hear in a couple of weeks. Why? I go on to ask how soon after receiving notification of the appointment will it be before the actual appointment - answer, don't know! Add to this the totally indifferent attitude of the person I spoke with on the phone and most will see there is much room for improvement. For the benefit of the management, this is the year 2015.

If it werent for his fathers insistance that he be seen he most definitely would have permanently lost these teeth. Despite the nurse in charge refusing him treatment and saying there were no dentists in a hospital sure enough one treated him. It is disgusting that a nurse paid to help and treat injuries would behave in this way. it did not enter their mind to check to see if there was any damage to his head after the impact.

I think there is some room for improvement around the manner of the staff. They did not introduce themselves and gave me very little information about the process. They asked me to undress and put the gown on but not what to do next. Did not explain what would happen with the x-ray, just gave me very fast instructions about hands on hips, breathe in, breathe out - done. I would have appreciated an introduction, undress here then you'll go into this room. You'll stand in front of a machine and need to breathe in and then out while we take the x-ray.

229746,"My father was admitted here after his doctor had referred Him. He was unable to breath when he was sitting up. As he is in a wheelchair this isn't good. He had a scan 6 weeks earlier which showe'd his apendix was swolen, as my father is unable to feel the pain due to his paralysis they ruled it out. He was admitted late at night. Then was discharged the next day without doing any other scans or tests, as they said he could breath alright when he is lying down. So he went home, didn't sleep at all because of the discomfort and was then referred to another hospital where they are now doing the tests. How can bournemouth hospital send someone home without finding out what is going on. And the answer that he can breath while lying down isn't a solution. I will never go back to this hospital because they just don't care.",1
229874,Had a ct scan booked for 08: 40. arrived at 08: 20 to read paper. Listened to the ct scan people talking in the office till 09: 00 when they started seeing patients. Had to wait for another half an hour to be seen. Layed down on the bed for my ct scan when told that I require an ultrasound and an injection of dye in my knee before I can have my ct scan and told to go away and await a phone call for another appointment. I had to take the morning off of work for this appointment and the wasted £3 in the car park. Furious is an understatement.,0
230190,"my daughter was admitted to an emergency ward as she had bloods done and doctor was concerned about the white cell count and the crp levels, so wanted her to have urgent CT scan. She had never been in hospital before and was very poorly and didn't know what to expect. the nurses didn't tell her what they were doing and what for. The urgent CT scan didn't take place til the following Tuesday 4 days later and by this time the consultant had made up their mind she was suffering from an illness, so prescribed steroids. they discharged her on the Thursday 7th May for her only to have been rushed into another hospital by ambulance for life saving surgery. I am totally disgusted with the treatment she suffered and what she has been put through. I would never send any family member to this hospital for anything. Wythenshawe hospital is a much better place to be treated",1
230187,"Why do the map and directions on the Altrincham Hospital web site take people to Lloyd Square, being a small dead-end courtyard, full of parked cars and nothing to do with the Hospital location? This function should have been fixed and updated before it was put on the web site, as it causes much confusion. There are also no car parks shown on the map. There should at least be a map showing the location of the new Hospital and all five car parks surrounding it - with walking routes from them (Regent Rd car park via Kings Court and Regent Rd; Tescos, Cinema and Total Fitness car parks via Goose Green and Sainsbury's via Lloyd St or Goose Green). Plus the location of the Interchange and walking route from that. The entrance canopy is crooked and leaking. It needs replacing already and lets down the high quality of the rest of the building. However, its great that after a long battle, we still have a handy hospital in the town centre - now with increased and improved services.",0
231118,"I can't fault the actual care & attitude of the care staff in Minor Injuries, they are really cheerful, calm, helpful and informative. I do agree with some other comments about the cost of parking ... if you're just over the free 20 min limit then it's at least £2 which seems high. Nevertheless I would still recommend the Samuel Johnson to others, especially for minor accidents that children may have: The department is small and personal and the care is effective and efficient i.e. It achieves what it sets out to achieve.",0
231043,"My GP referred me to this department. I received a Choose & Book your appointment (20-05-15) only to find out it's not possible to phone or go online to book an appointment. When you contact the department you are told a doctor will decide when to give an appointment. I have since had two reminders from Choose & Book service to make the appointment. But no contact from the actual department about getting an appointment. It's now 30-05-15, what a shambolic service.",0
231414,"I had Laparoscopy this year. While the consultation and surgery went well, I was left in agony after, due to the fact that my body was rejecting the Mirena Coil just hours after the surgery. It was awfully painful when I was told to get up and walk, the worst pain I have ever experienced. I ended up being readmitted twice after. The first time I was readmitted I was treated with respect, the second time however I wasn't. I hope future patients are treated with more compassion. The Mirena Coil does not agree with everyone and when the body rejects it, it is pure agony.",1
231575,"recently moved into this area and visited your hospital for a procedure on the 5 May 15. I was given a feedback card to complete but your staff deserve so much more. From the phone call I initially received through to the treatment and follow up letter confirming the results, I was treated with dignity and respect and as an individual. In addition, all the communication I received whether verbal or written was user friendly & easy to understand. All the staff are so friendly and caring. I have to say this is so reassuring and appreciated and given me confidence in visiting you in the future. Thank you so much for my care. It's first class!",0
232354,"I have myself recently visited HRI A&E which is pathetic to say the least, while I understand you are not seen depending on arrival but injury I now realise I should have pretended to twist my ankle along with my actual injury of nearly slicing my finger off resulting 2 1/2 hours later in 5 stitches, thankfully I was capable of reminding the nurse 3 times it was my left hand and not right to ensure I got the correct attention otherwise god knows what I would have left with - youd think it was obvious with blood pouring from the injured area but seemingly not. The A&E staff including receptionists who ignored a woman with crying child stood directly infront of them to ""chat"" with a passing nurse all seemed rather slow, whilst I was having my stitches the room was then also occupied with an elderly lady being consulted over some sort of leg pain, whilst the curtains were pulled across not one of the consultants bothered to ensure she could not be seen while checking her over which meant moving her clothing, this along with the pain will have been very distressful for a patient surrounded by others. Recently a friend of mine' relative was admitted after suffering a stroke, he was placed on the initial stroke ward. The blatant disregard for his wellfare and I am sure others around the hospital was disgraceful. He was left to sit in dirty, sheets covered in sick until his family requested them to be changed, left in the toilet alone for nearly an hour due to one of the two nurses who took him leaving and there needing to be two there to bring him back - do you actually just leave a patient alone in the toilet?! His family have heared themselves being mocked by nurses and we're too scared to make complaints in case their family member suffered the consequences, feeling helpless when he was in horrific pain and discomfort he waited over 6 hours for pain relief one day, thankfully he has been released home now to continue his rehabilitation with people who didn't enter a qualified caring profession and I imagine will do a better job regardless simply because they actually care. My aunt suffered what turned out to be a life threatening apendicitis, orginially ignored as she was left sitting in your A&E department for 3 hours because - you staff thought she was too old to suffer from one, some of us manage pain differently but it doesn't mean we are ok! My main gripe is this - I have supported the NHS and nursing profession all my years and I do agree that they are in majority underpaid and overworked but what I don't understand is why so many abhorently ignorant and careless people decide that a proffesion hellping others is for them? Anyone in hospital should feel safe, comfortable and loved, anyone who can't administer that should stop nursing immediately!",1
233512,"Not the first time I have used this service for myself or accompanying friends and always been impressed with the set up, but this was the first time in the new building which is a clean, well equipped and designed space. I was initially seen, had X Rays, reassessed and given a plaster cast all very quickly and efficiently. I was given clear and helpful information at every stage from all staff members I interacted with, everyone was very polite, friendly and professional. They arranged a follow up appointment in a really helpful and convenient manner. As an NHS employee myself, I think this an example of a great service that takes pressure off A&E units. I recommend to friends/work colleagues/sport teammates with minor injuries.",0
233660,had this camera test - sigmoidoscopy. staff friendly and helpful and go through the process bit by bit. so you know what is going to happen next. dr who does camera test. speaks and explains what is happening as it happens. nothing to the test. just lay on your side on hospital type bed / trolley. relax and its over and done with in about 10 minutes you just get wheeled in to a recovery area. for little while. you just get given an enema. also nothing to worry about. again just relax,0
233675,"After taking an overdose, I voluntarily went to this hospital to receive some help. After attempts at getting blood from me were abandoned because my veins had collapsed and I had a severe panic attack, I was told by the Junior Doctor that she would rather treat people that wanted to live. I was also accused of being unco-operative and difficult and told that I would have to wait several hours for treatment. After being in such pain from the blood taking attempts I walked out of the hospital and attempted to take another overdose at home. Fortunately a friend intervened. This whole experience has left me with a severe needle phobia and I will never visit a hospital again when experiencing a mental health crisis. At a time when I was most vulnerable I needed to be treated with compassion and care. This was not what I received.",1
234721,"My mother suffered a fall while visiting Eastbourne to scatter my dads ashes resulting in her having an operation to replace her hip. In her obviously distressed state Brighton hospital attempted to get her transferred nearer home. On Tuesday Bolton agreed to take her and having waited 3 days for a bed we were told a bed was available on Friday 12th June. Her transport was arranged and her belongings packed, then as the transport was on its way they decided that as her GP was in Hindley they wouldn't take her. Obviously her GP had always been in Hindley and you can only imagine how distressing this was for her. How cruel can people be, such a caring hospital",0
234634,"My elderly father was admitted for treatment of a bout of pneumonia and I was appalled at the inadequate staffing levels and appalling communication within the ward. My father was given IV hydration but not checked to see if he was passing urine (he has congestive cardiac failure and needs diuretics) and if I had not picked up on this, his condition would have worsened. A severely confused patient was left in a urine soaked bed unchecked and I had to prevent him from choking on a spoon. My father then developed a urinary infection and despite my repeated requests for this to be addressed and my concerns about increasing confusion plus his previous history of infection related delirium, nothing was done. My father ended up in an acute confusional state, became extremely distressed and agitated and despite psychotropic medication being prescribed as required to calm him, this was not given and he was instead moved to a single room and left. This situation was totally preventable. I am a registered mental health nurse of 20 years and was appalled by the lack of response. A ward sister was rude and dismissive. I was given conflicting and contradictory information and there was no clear communication within the team let alone with patients and family members. When finally discharged, my father could barely walk, had swollen inflamed legs and no home care was offered or organised. My elderly mother was instead left to cope alone with me and my sister doing our best to support her (I live 100 miles away). Many of the nursing staff were kind, some albeit in a rather patronising way, and although staff were working flat out, there simply were not enough of them and no clear leadership. It was like a ship without a captain lurching along in a haphazard chaotic way. What I do find unforgiveable is that fellow registered nurses failed to listen to my very legitimate concerns and ignored warning signs. I was not someone that was constantly criticising or nit picking as I could see how overstretched they were and only raised urgent issues when required. The fact that they still didn't listen or act still upsets me to this day.",1
234630,"My elderly father became delirious due to an infection whilst an inpatient in Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The ward staff did not listen to my concerns (I am a registered mental heath nurse) and my father suffered immensely as a result. The turning point was his referral to the Psychiatric Liaison Team. The nurse, Izzie, listened to my concerns and took them seriously, she assessed my father thoughly in a professional and extremely respectful sensitive way- the only one to treat him like an adult rather than a naughty child. She very quickly put a sensible and realistic treatment plan in place, ensured that it was implimented and kept me informed throughout the process. I felt that she really valued and embraced partnership working with patients and carers. My father is now recovering and thankfully cannot remember the worst of his experience. I am not convinced that he would have recovered if it had not been for Izzie so thank her greatly for acting so swiftly and professionally to get my dad back.",1
234809,"Un fortunately my daughter was transfered from Eastbourne DGH to Conquest Edgeton ward on Wednesday 17th June (2015) for surgery on her ulcerated shin. The ward was dirty! The curtains around her bed were dusty and when opened a cloud of dust decended. There were dust clumps rolling over the floors and under beds. Worst of all was the patients toilet! the toilet seat was covered in dried excrement! I dred to think what the underside of the toilet seat was like. My daughter , and other patients in her ward, all have open wounds. It is so bad and unclean that my daughter fears for her safety and she has requested to be returned home a.s.a.p! This is so unaceptable for a hospital. The nursing staff and doctors were, however, wonderful! Sincerely disgusted and upset",0

After 5 days, the family had not been informed of anything...the nurses on the ward were not even aware of his condition. That evening a family member visited & he wasn't there...she was advised he was at Freeman hospital for radiotherapy....again, no one had been advised. He has deteriorated so badly during his stay, to which I am sure the following have contributed... Being left in the bedside chair for hours with only a hospital gown on, he was freezing & his temperature was down. His daily steroid was stopped for 3 days on admission. Not having his medication explained to him, so as he had no pain, refusing all tablets as he thought they were painkillers...so no medication at all for 2-3 days. He said nobody talked to him, only at him. The tablets he refused to take, were left lying on his bed table. Incontinence pads frequently not put on him, including for his journey home. Although not the wards fault, the cooked food is absolutely disgusting & my father wouldn't touch it. Was sent home from hospital with only his pyjamas on & a thin hospital blanket & was really cold on arriving home. He also arrived home with a chest infection & cough, for which we had to ask our GP to visit within hours of discharge from hospital. He has deteriorated so badly after 2 weeks on this ward. After being told he wasn't poorly enough for a Macmillan nurse, our GP is involving one immediately. I wish he had never been sent to hospital, as it has been so traumatic for him.",1

He has had many falls banging his head each time. In the early days he was admitted to hospital and even given time at Barton which allowed him to come home. Now he is in a pathetic state and has had 2 falls this week. He was admitted to hospital on my Husband's insistence glued up and then sent home the next day( without anybody informing his son), unable to even operate his walking frame because he is too doddery. His hair is matted and he looks so poorly that my daughter has stopped taking her daughters to visit him. This morning he has fallen again hitting his head on the toilet. First Call called the ambulance and they have refused to take him to hospital because they consider him not' bad enough'!! So he is waiting to be glued up again? I informed the doctor that unless something is done for him there is going to be a real mess for somebody to find.

I feel discusted that a nurse has been told my partner he is suffering shortness of breath, chest pains and bringing blood up and feels they can diagnose him with a simple chest infection without even listening to his chest and to also tell him you have probably just got a chest infection.

However after a very long wait my two year old in agony, we were frankly persistently questioned to how she got her injury they xrayed repeatedly to decide she may have a pulled elbow and basically accused my husband and myself of causing say injury.they couldn't find evidence to show this so sent us home my child in agony two days later we return as nothing had changed to the same questioning, to finally discover she had a small hairline fracture! So for two days our toddler suffered by sheer negligence of the a&e staff! Disgusting! No apology for all the rude questioning, we will never go back to the royal Berkshire hospital ever.

237372,"Just spent best part of an hour trying (and failing) to rearrange an appointment to pick up insoles (that I'd been measured for by a very helpful member of staff a couple of months previously). Very long call wait times made this an even more frustrating experience. 1) Rang main switchboard - Told to ring appointment helpline, 2) Rang appt helpline - no record of me, 3) Put me through to orthopaedics - wrong department, 4) Rang main switchboard - asked to be put through to Orthotics, 5) Eventually got put through to Pre-assessment(!) - they at least were polite and helpfully gave me Orthotics direct number, 6) Rang Orthotics number - line dead. 7) Give up, and let off steam by writing a negative review on the internet. Surely it must be cost efficient to improve the appointment system? (missed appointments/wasted time for staff answering misdirected calls/increased intake from patients getting so stressed they have a heart attack?) If it's too expensive to make the process digital so I can alter my appointment myself online, at very least ensure the appt helpline can cover all areas of the hospital?",0

When he has a chest infection plus sore throat, he refuses to eat (it hurts his throat) and needs to be rehydrated. Much as we are wary of antibiotics, a course of them has always seen him back to full health and appetite within a couple of days. On this occasion he was not prescribed antibiotics, as the hospital doctor had diagnosed gastro-enteritis and said his chest was clear. My son was offered food by the nurses but they had no time to spend on feeding him (he was too weak to feed himself) and took it away again. Luckily he had constant visitors during the day and between us we coaxed him into eating high-calorie yoghurts supplied by the hospital, teaspoon by teaspoon, to get some nutrition into him. He was discharged while still unwell, as the doctor was afraid he would pick up a hospital infection. His own GP then diagnosed a chest infection, prescribed a course of antibiotics and he recovered quickly.",1

As a family we experienced many different areas of the hospital and wanted to express our gratitude and heartfelt thanks for the care she received. It was an extremely traumatic and difficult time for us as a family as my mother had only received her terminal cancer diagnosis four weeks previously. We wanted to especially thank the nursing staff on Lowen Ward and her consultant. There were also two junior doctors on Lowen Ward, who showed our mother unfailing kindness and care. They were excellent communicators and as a family we felt well informed at all times. If all junior doctors in the NHS are as impressive as these two then the NHS has a bright future. I hope that positive reviews are fed directly back to the people concerned?",0
241242,"In June this year, my mother got very ill with a chest infection and diarrhea. I rang 111 at about 11pm. My mother also suffered from copd as evidenced by an oxygen machine. By the time the doctor came at 1145pm, my mother had fallen asleep. The doctor very briefly examined my mother whist she was still asleep; at no point did he wake her up to ask her questions or properly diagnose her. He told me she had slight cracking on her shoulders but it was nothing much to worry about and he would get me some antibiotics and a drug to treat the diarrhea. He also said I did not need to give them to her until the morning with some food, some eight or nine hours away. I did precisely as he instructed. Around 2pm, my mother suddenly developed what I now know to have been a focal seizure/TIA. I range 999 immediately and the paramedics attended within four minutes. However, by the time they arrived my mother although obviously not well had recovered from the TIA. At no point during their visit did they ever mention the TIA. Nor did they mention, my mother should go to hospital for an assessment. Instead, they diagnosed my mother's chest infection and pronounced that it was only a slight chest infection and that my mother did not need to go to hospital as it was being treated by the antibiotics prescribed by the on call doctor. As my mother seemed so ill and weak, I repeatedly asked the senior paramedic if my mum could be suffering from pneumonia. She replied that it was impossible for my mother to be suffering from pneumonia as her body temperature was only slightly raised and it would have to be a lot higher if my mother was suffering from pneumonia. As the senior paramedic then just advised me to give my mother some paracetamol to help reduce her slight temperature I never intervened when she suggested to my mother that she did not need to go to hospital and it was up to my mother if she still thought she should go. After all for some reason, perhaps shock I had forgot about her TIA and the senior paramedic had consistently told me my mother was ok and definitely not suffering from pneumonia. This reinforced the doctors diagnosis that my mother was only suffering from a minor chest infection. Anyway, the paramedics left. Two hours later my mother had another seizure, only this one was worse. I called 999, they came quickly and assessed my mother's medical situation as critical. She was blue lighted to the Norfolk and Norwich University hospital. She went to the resussication unit and then the acute medical unit. It was there I was told that she was suffering from severe pneumonia and was unlikely to survive. If only the doctor had woke her to examine her fully she at least would have had a much better chance to survive. My mother began responding to the IV antibiotics in hospital but suffered a significant stroke sometime in the early hours at the beginning of July. The medical staff never treated her TIA's as they said she was so severely ill with pneumonia. She was diagnosed as suffering from a Glasgow level three coma and end of life treatment commenced. She passed away after such a brave and dignified fight at 330am a couple of days later. She was a wonderful caring person in such contrast to the highly trained and experienced on call doctor and first senior paramedic attending my mother. In the four weeks since it first happened, I have only just realized why my mother was not admitted to hospital and it was because, in my opinion, some doctors and some paramedics feel the need to act as gate keepers to the local hospital, especially when it comes to the elderly. I am certain if my mother had been a lot younger, given her so obviously life threatening symptoms they would have admitted to hospital immediately. My mother deserved so much more and if I could not protect my mother from their inactions what chance can other elderly patients have from such people. I have lost all trust in the East of England Ambulance service though I realize that many of their personnel are highly trained and caring professionals who always make the best clinical choices for all their patients, however old they are. It is just that when my mother most needed those kind of medical personnel, she so terribly unfortunately did not get them and her life chances were ended.",1
241578,please would someone in authority try to ring breast clinic reception on 622631 to see how hard it is to speak to a member of staff. I have tried over 7 days now at various times of the day both direct dialling & through the switchboard. it is either engaged or I get the ring tone for exactly 6.15 minutes before the phone is cut off only to try to get through again. the call centre on 604444 cant change appointments apparently so they advise to ring the clinic directly but it is impossible to actually speak to anyone there. it would be helpful if the 604444 call centre staff could change my appointment or if I could do it on line like the 'choose & book' system allows. it is extremely stressful enough to be having tests & this situation just adds to that stress. please review this thanks,0

242193,"I have done this review on behalf of my dad who spent about five weeks at the royal due to the fact he had terminal lung cancer. the NHS go on about dying with dignity this was not so in the case of my dad. he had been in the hospital about a week when i had to get in touch with his lung nurse to get his care sorted out. On one visit to him he had been put in a corner bed,he was dirty, smelly and there was blood all over his bedding, he was distressed and I felt uncared for and forgotten.We could never find a doctor who would sit us down and explain to us about dads cancer, we were told they had told dad bearing in mind dads cancer had spread to his brain he was not able to understand what they were saying. My family and I feel disgusted with our dads care at the royal we feel that because he was old and dying he was forgotten. He has since passed away at St Marys Hospital Melton Mowbray with dignity.",1

The Dr's response was diarrhoea and bleeding are not life threatening or unusual. I was sent home. 2 hours later I was rushed back to A&E with vomiting abdominal pain lower back pain chest pain severe diarrhoea and increasing bleeding. The staff attempted to make me comfortable again to discharge me my sister refused to allow me to be discharged saying if I had to lie in the waiting area so be it. I asked for a commode there was only one in A&E so everytime I used it staff took the whole commode, it was taking longer and longer for them to bring it back. It was soon evident that my condition was deteriorating the blood loss was increasing the pain was unbearable after 2 hours a surgeon arrived I was hooked up to a drip after another hour another surgeon arrived and I was booked on to a ward at 3am on Wednesday 28th August.",1
242778,I defy anyone to try getting in touch with any neuorogists secretary - either at Oldham or Salford! The first one is away so they leave a message with another number you can try. You try that number and there's another message with yet another number to try. You try that number and there's another message with yet another number to try. You try that number and there's another message with yet another number to try. You try that number and there's another message with yet another number to try. This goes on a few more times until you finally get given the first number again!! This has gone on for 2 weeks! Does anyone still work there? Very frustrating indeed!,0
242935,"After an emergency c section my wife was left in pain and had to constantly beg for pain relief. At one point she was refused medication that was prescribed and told that she should feel better, later the same night she was told that they had run out of the prescribed medicine. She had to be admitted back into hospital the day after discharge as she had a really aggressive infection, and once again she has been made to feel weak and like an addict because she asks for medication. I was there when she pressed her buzzer for pain relief, when this wasn't answered I went to the nurses station where I was asked to cancel the alarm (which they hadn't responded to), and told if she wanted pain meds it would mean they would have to page a registrar, even though the meds were prescribed. Also on this ward, from the day my son was born, every nurse, midwife and doctor who saw him commented that he looked jaundiced. He was seen every day and it was remarked upon every day, finally after 7 days a midwife decided to test him to see if he needed treatment, by this time he did. I am currently in the process of signing my family up for BUPA as the thought of my family been treated in this hospital fills me with fear.",1

243020,"Both of my parents sadly passed away in Lincoln County Hospital and the palliative care they both received was abysmal. My mother spent almost 6 months in hospital with various ailments including gall bladder problems, which the hospital decided against removing. During her stay she contracted C diff on several occasions which I often wonder contributed to her passing away as she died from a perforated intestine. During the last 48 hours of her life, my mother was in excruciating pain, so much so she said she just wanted to die, we requested strong pain relief late one Friday evening , this took over an hour to be administered due to only one doctor being on duty covering 15 wards.... Disgraceful. My mother passed away 36 hours later. My father was admitted with severe breathing problems, an x Ray 3 weeks earlier had allegedly shown a small tumour on the lung, a cat scan 24 hours after being admitted showed up multiple tumours and nothing could be done. My father was placed on a ward that was very noisy and had patients with many problems that caused a lot of disruption, this wasn't acceptable for my father who was dying and after a lot of arguing with nurses a consultant agreed to move my dad to a side ward. The palliative care he received was minimal, catheters weren't emptied regularly, pain relief wasn't administered despite my father being in a lot of pain and very distressed. Nursing staff on the whole did the very minimal and no doctors visited my father after we were told he was dying. My father passed away 2days after being diagnosed with terminal cancer at approx 4.30 pm on a sat, we needed the death certificate, but couldn't be issued at the weekend due to lack of doctors and on ringing the hospital on the Monday were advised it wouldn't be issued until Tuesday. Not acceptable and after speaking to one compassionate young doctor who kindly agreed to have it ready for later on that day. Overall impression of Lincoln County hospital..... Very poor. Do I ever want to step in that hospital again.... No way.",1

243457,"My 91 year old uncle was taken to the Emergency Department on Saturday having been taken in by his 78 year old neighbour after waiting 4 hours for an ambulance. He was suffering from severe stomach pains. She was told to go home and they would look after him. They diagnosed him as having a bladder infection, gave him antibiotics and then discharged him. He lives alone, uses a walking frame and was sent home in a taxi by the hospital at 4am Sunday morning. No one was notified that this had happened and the taxi driver did not see him into his bungalow. Having got into his front door he fell and the family were notified by one of his neighbours. He then had to admitted again later that day after we had to call out the emergency doctor as he was having difficulty moving. We were asked if we would mind taking him to the hospital. The doctor he saw in A&E was very thorough and when we told them that he had been discharged that morning they agreed that it should not have happened and they apologised. The nurse who put in the cannula even recognised him from the night before and was surprised that he had been discharged and he confirmed that he was very unsteady on his feet. There for the grace of god my uncle is recovering no thanks to Kings Mill Hospital who could easily have had another death on their hands.",1
243304,I attended the hospital as a sufferer of SCD who had a painful crisis and I was not given any treatment. I waited in the hospital for hours without being seen and was not given any medication to deal with the pain like the usual procedure that would take place at other hospitals. It was clear that this hospital did not know how to deal with Sickle cell patients and thus abandoned me. A trained doctor even went as far as saying that I did not have the disease despite being diagnosed from birth and suffering from the disease daily. I was so dissapointed by the lack of care that I discharged myself. This is not the first time that the hospital has shown a lack of care. Several years ago I had phenomena and I was told that it was a cold. This was life threatening as if I had not gone to another hospital to get checked I would have been seriously ill as I already have sickle cell disease.,1

As he had he tonsils removed 4 days prior we were extra concerned. However to my disbelief my son had been turned away by the receptionist at the time as his surgery took place a Great Ormand Street Hospital (GOSH) and said he should take my son back there. Disgusted that a hospital would refuse to see a sick child, for such a ridiculous reason, I phoned GOSH to ask what I should do. They too were both shocked and disgusted and reassured me that the receptionist at central middlesex A&E was wrong and GOSH unlike the receptionist at central middlesex were extremely helpful. I feel as though my child was put at serious risk. GOSH is 45mins away. Should anything have happened to him after being turned away from this hospital, that perosn would have been liable.

244690,My mam who is 82 years old was taken into this hospital with severe bleeding on her legs after having melanoma skin lumps removed at the rvi. She is on warfrin so the bleeding had to be controlled. After being taken to Cramlington three times within two days she was kept in on Wednesday 5th August 2015. She was put into ward 12. When we came to visit on the Thursday she was crying with pain in her legs she had been promised pain killers no one brought them. She had been put into the toilet and told to pull the cord when she was finished. When she pulled the cord the whole thing just fell off . After sitting on the toilet waiting for someone to come back in to help her she managed to get back to her bed from the toilet on her own. Fortunately she hadnt fell as she could hardly walk. I dread to think how long she would have been lying in pain if we hadn't came in visiting. After we arrived and I got a nurse and informed them the hospital was a shambles she was given morphine and a doctor was brought to check her legs. Extremely disappointed with this hospital,1

Anyway to cut a long story short Medway were unable to preform the surgery on my son as the weekend surgeon did not deal with children, eleven hours after we arrived at Medway we were transferred to kings in London and by the time he had surgery his appendix had become pussy, stuck to his other organs and were close to bursting, he had to have his insides washed out and spend 4 nights at kings as they refused to transfer him back, I will never take any of my family back to this hell hole.",1

245670,"The hearing aids I was issued with look like cheap tat. They used to issue hearing aids in dignified colours like taupe and slate grey, and I've looked on the manufacturer's website and they make the model in a range of colours, so I assume the choice of colour was dictated by price, although I can't see why different colours would be different prices unless the manufacturer wanted to offload a batch that it couldn't get rid of through the private market. However, the NHS manages to use its size to negotiate cheap drug prices, so why not cheap prices for good hearing aids? I shall be saving up for private hearing aids. I appreciate that they will be expensive but I don't think that being disabled should mean using ugly shiny metallic coloured equipment unless you absolutely have to. It would be nice if they offered the opportunity to pay for an upgrade to something more neutral. As a general comment, be prepared for aids with very small buttons not best suited to ageing rheumatic fingers. The battery compartment is difficult to open, and when you open it, there's a sharp bit to catch your skin, but that can be dealt with by using a nail file or knife to open the battery compartment.",0
245769,"It is a pity that the department still uses paper scrips; and I guess the same for all other departments. Departments should have access to current stock held in the pharmacy and the scrip should be electronically sent from the department to the pharmacy. The current paper based system appears cumbersome and time and resource intensive. In addition, if the pharmacy does not stock an item, the duty pharmacist has to get hold of the doctor, who, if unavailable has to then get hold of the pharmacist to be told that the scrip cannot be fulfilled. Whilst this is happening, the patient has to wait; in my case 45+ minutes. It appears that the system then has the doctor contact the patient's GP to get the GP to raise a scrip; this is done electronically but still relies upon someone sending the information to the GP. Requires improvement I suggest.",0

He had been having severe ankle and foot pain ( with no trauma to it)with swelling that even after home care wasn't getting better. My husband is also very reluctant to seek medical advice and so when he read his heart literature and it said some patients suffer blood clots in their legs he became worried and asked to go to a&e this in itself worried me. On arrival we were spoken kindly to by the receptionist, gave our details and asked to waitn. After a small wait we were seen by an extremely rude and condescending nurse. My husband tried to outline his condition before telling the nurse his problem and had only got one sentence out before he was rudely interrupted and asked...but that's not what you've come in for is it? After explaining his ankle problem and then his worry of blood clot he was told that his ankle wasn't even swollen and when my husband asked the nurse why they thought his problem wasn't heart related the nurse answered ....because I think so! at the end the nurse asked my husband if he wanted pain relief and my husband explained he couldn't have ibuprofen and before he could continue the nurse snapped that they were not offering him that. I have to say I have never been so angry or upset that my husband's worries were made to feel silly and there were no kind reassurance at all, just rudeness. After being asked to wait to see a doctor my husband was so affected by the nurses comments he wanted to go home without any further treatment. He felt like a nuisance and that he shouldn't have been there for just a hurt ankle. So instead of coming home feeling reassured and calm, we returned upset and my husband is still in pain. He is waiting now to see his trusty GP who no matter how busy the doctor is always treats their patients with the utmost respect and concern. I will not be returning to kings mill ever!",0

247788,Mum was in hospital for several weeks. The after care was poorly planned and as a result inadequate causing stress to her and her husband. She had to be re-hospitalised. During her stay ward staff expressed satisfaction with her. When paramedics asked for her to return after the post hospital care had failed the ward staff said she had not cooperated. After several weeks I rehabilitation she was weaker and less able but still sent home. Not home visit for assessment was made. As a result I lost confidence in what the ward staff told me about her during her stay. Both she and her husband have been caused unnecessary distress by the experience. Following the failure of her planned after care mum was readmitted to Kings Mill and then transferred to Newark where she currently is. We are hoping for a better outcome.,1

Unfortunatlely it didn't work and a week later I had a rupture. I walked into Barnet A&E and told them I had an ectopic and believed I had ruptured and was in extreme pain. After waiting 20 minutes my brother arrived at A&E and was shocked I hadn't been seen straight away! He demanded they assess me and I was admitted to the emergency gynae ward. Even though they knew I had a life threatening diagnosis they left me with internal bleeding on that ward for over 20 hours with a morphine drip waiting for a simple ultrasound! I kept asking the nurses when I would get the scan and they said when ultrasound team was ready they would call me. They knew I was in pain and kept offering me drugs. They kept me nil by mouth and kept pumping fluilds and morphine into me. When my fiance arrived the next day he was stunned that I hadn't been seen and threatened to take me to another hospital right away. The ultrasound team then gave me a scan and said none of the nurses has told them about me! They found I had a ruptured right tube and internal bleeding and was told I need emergency surgery. My fiance was so angry and didn't trust Barnet with the surgery after the complete mess they had already made, the doctor kept apologising but we were fed up and I was so frightened, so I self discharged and he took me straight to West Middlesex hospital where they successfully performed emergency laproscopic surgery to remove my right tube and everything was resolved within 6 hours. This was my first experience being hospitalised on the NHS as I've had private before. I thought this must be how all NHS services are, but West Middlesex was fantastic. They kept trying to ring Barnet to get my records and no one at Barnet would answer the phones! I am so angry and shocked by the care at Barnet, the gynaecology ward (Willow Ward) is nurse-led and it seems that non of the staff are accountable to anyone. It wasn't just me, other ladies were being neglected as well. One lady next to me had lost all feeling from the waist down after an epidural for a hsyterectomy. I witnessed a nurse vernally abuse an elderly patient. It was terrifying. The nurses were rude, loud, had foul attitudes and poor team communication. The outpatient EPU care was fantastic but the care on the ward was absolutely shocking, it was like the Francis report and Mid Staffordshire scandal come to life.",1
248234,"The initial welcome is through a smoke-filled haze as the entrance is full of smoking visitors and patients - even some bringing their drips with them! The care provided is very variable, depending very much on the member of staff providing it. Some staff leave a wrapped sandwich out of reach of 90 year old with difficulty gripping, whilst others unwrap, cut up and even offer to feed if required. This looks to be an issue of training (or lack of it) for the former category. Once past the smoke haze, the hospital gives the impression of a light, calm and clean environment.",0
248213,"I thought I might have broken my finger so visited the MIU yesterday afternoon. I arrived about 3.30 and left about 75 minutes later after exam and X-Ray which found no fractures. Timely, efficient, professional but friendly service. Excellent:: many thanks and well done to all concerned. My only other comments are (inevitably car-parking related!) that a) it would be helpful to tell new arrivals before they park - a signpost at the entrance? - that the car park machines don't take credit cards (and why not in 2015?!) and that the nearest cash machine is across the road on the University campus and b) that for what they charge for parking, Sodhexo or whoever should be able to afford to re-paint the direction arrows on the car park roadway so that the way out isn't largely guesswork!",0

Seen at appointed time, operation explained fully in layman's language, put completely at ease and breezed through entire process with no delay. Nothing but praise for all staff. The central booking in procedure also very quick with proper queue lines so that also big improvement. Price of the café made my eyes water so hope some of that profit goes back to the NHS.

On all 4 occasions we have been seen very promptly (in and out of the hospital in less than 30mins for both scans and in and out within an hour for both trips to A&E). On each occasion we have received excellent care and information. In a world where it's quite clear that budgets and staff within the NHS are under immense pressure, we'd just like to say thank you to all the staff for their excellent work and commitment.",0
249129,"Very nice staff who were there to support and offer reassurance throughout the procedure. The procedure was carried out with as much diginity and privacy as could be expected in the circumstances. The only issue I would raise are the very long waiting times to get the initial appointment, 15 weeks +, and then the lack of information about how long the results of the biopsy will take (""At least 2 weeks""). Having said that these issue's relate to resources and not the staff so please don't let this be a negative reflection on them. Many Thanks",0
249393,"I experienced the most traumatic time of my life staying at Preston hospital following a bone graft and manipulation under anesthetic for a frozen knee. Despite being immediately refereed to the acute pain management team, I was left for 6 days with in adequate and inconsistent pain relief before I received a visit from them. I was placed on a CPM machine but in a manner that was inhumane, and contrary to the recommended instructions. I became very distressed yet my distress was either ignored or belittled by staff who were unemphatic and was actually verbally abused by one doctor. I will never set foot in that hospital ever again.",1

249769,"On my first visit to the Rheumatology Department I found the main signage for locating the department to be lacking. I feel Rheumatology is an important part of the hospital and clearer more prominent signage for patients when viewed from a 'patients first visit from reception onwards' is very important. I trust that this can be improved, I look forward to a reply from Central Middlesex Hospital regarding the improvement. The staff and consultants within Rheumatology Dept. go the extra mile in making patients feel welcome and at ease. Many thanks. Wendy",0

The staff are helpful and well informed. The consultant themself goes beyond their remit. They listen you feel part of your treatment decisions not just a tick box exercise. Their department deliver treatment with the limited resources. This department is definafely a Center of Excellence. The support group again is a great achievement and agreat source of knowledge sharing educational value and a great support network for patients. This is as prime example of partnership working patients and clinicians. Long may it reign. Please invest more resource to expand research and grow not only this dept but look to utilise CMH to its full potential",0

Machine was not accepting cards also sell taped to the machine was a small notice that none of the machines on site accept £20 notes. Had to go back to the hospital shop no change! Then had to go to the coffee shop and purchase 2 coffees to get change. By we got back to the car the fee had increased to £4. Baring in mind that it was a dry day, I was able to go back and forth this could have been someone not in the same position. In addition to this the car parking is offering a £17. 50 weekly ticket. If purchased I would expect this would be by card or a £20 note. Frustrating 😒",0

Family suspected lyme disease and asked to check. However, patient woken up at 2am and asked have they visited the New Forest, when answered no nothing further done. Sent home. That was over 4 years ago and now has chronic lyme and having to seek treatment in USA. If doctors were trained sufficiently to recognise these clinical symptoms this could have been prevented and the disease cured in the early stages. The blood test taken was too early for any antibody response. PHE states that lyme disease can clinically assessed without waiting for blood tests. The blood tests are unreliable.",1

250129,"I always thought that effective communication with patients is a professional code of conduct: phone calls are not answered; when answered the task is always passed back to me to write in the request. There is no response to the letter. How do you expect me to make a decision regarding a treatment if there is no help with answering my queries. Treatment is an ongoing process and is not only dealt with on the appointment days. Please make some time to respond to patients' queries either by phone, email or by letter. Thanks",0
250351,"Congratulations to the Sister of Ward18, Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist. An excellent overview about the operation, pre and post operative care. The presentation was clear and the written information booklet given to patients is a valuable, helpful addition. The print is easy to read. The diagrams of breathing and leg exercises help aid understanding and patients are encouraged to do these so the muscles etc are in an optimum state before surgery to enhance recovery. There were useful pointers on how to organise the home on discharge. The ward look clean and it was obvious that care was given to infection control. Extra input was spontaneously given to a hearing impaired patient. The written presentation and booklet are useful for hearing impaired. There may be a method of communication for learning difficulties ? Well done. Very useful, informative, empowering and should help to minimise anxieties. Thought has also been put into not aftercare. Provision of a telephone number is given for any queries should they arise after discharge.",0
250347,"I have to come here regularly for blood tests, outpatient appointments, endoscopy dept. & X-ray dept. I even had to visit the MIU last year after a fall on a weekend. I have always been treated with the utmost respect by everyone concerned & always seen as quickly as possible. I can't praise the staff enough here from the receptionists through to every member of staff in every dept I have mentioned. They always smile & are ready to answer any questions & give assistance always with a smile which is much appreciated by me. They are all very professional but with the human touch too. The wrvs staff make a lovely tea & coffee too - what a great service they give voluntarily! I also have to visit Leighton too & feel the same about their service. People are very quick to complain I find but not to praise. Please keep it up you are all a credit to the NHS. Thank you so much",0

The process is always smooth and the Consultants listen and are informative on what is happening and what the future may hold. I have every confidence in them all. Yes people do moan sometimes if the time allotted to see them go's over but I don't have a problem with that if it is reasonable. Some patients want to talk longer and i realise it would be rude to try and usher them out. I also enjoy the forum, it's very good indeed Thank-you.",0
250320,"Having tried 5 times today to speak to someone in order to change my appointment (scheduled for today at 18:15), I ended up having to leave a message on the answer machine which clearly states that they will get back to you in 24 hours. This obviously doesn't help as I do not want a ""DNA"" on the system when I have made several attempts to get the appointment changed. Thinking that I may have a wrong number, I went onto the hospital website; which clearly states the following: ""Cancelling or changing your MRI appointment at St Mary's Hospital If you wish to cancel or change your MRI appointment at St Mary's Hospital please contact our imaging call centre on 020 3312 6418."" I called this number at 10:55am only to be told that I need to be transferred. Guess where I ended up, on the same answering machine that I had left a message on earlier. It seems as though the information on the website is misleading and the person who is able to change appointments is inundated with work and is unable to keep up with the demand (hence the answering machine service every time I called at 15-30 minute intervals) Set up an e-booking service where patients can change the appointment online rather than being sent from pillar to post. Annoyed to say the least",0

The after care I received following my operation was first class. The catering staff also for the menu choice & standard of food ,I can honestly say all meals I had where lovely. One thing was noticeable to me was that all staff carried out there duties in a cheerful & positive manner. Can you please ensure my thanks is passed on to all staff.Thanks.",0
250706,"My partner has visited the A&E department numerous times over the past 6 weeks. She has been suffering with unexplained collapses and seizures. We had to call an ambulance again today as she had 3 black out/seizure episodes but on this occasion the left side of her face had dropped (has happened previously) and she lost all feeling in her left arm and leg. She was very distressed and could not speak. An ambulance was called and arrived very quickly. The paramedics were fantastic! They advised they could not rule out a stroke or TIA and she needed to be taken in ASAP. We then arrived in Milton Keynes Hospital via ambulance, she was more coherent by this time but still had the facial weakness and tingles in her arm and leg. Having been through this previously: although not to this extremity I knew how severe the situation could be and if it was a stroke or TIA she needed to be assessed immediately. The nurse came to speak to the paramedics, they handed over their findings and were not listened to. The nurse failed to take on the fact that my partner was awaiting a neurology appointment and had lost feeling on her right side. The nurse dod pick up on the fact that my partner has ongoing gastro issues and that was all they seemed to take in. My partner was booked in as having gastro pain and was dispatched to the waiting room by wheelchair to wait for triage. This has never happened before. The severity of her symptoms means she has always been admitted and monitored immediately and even kept in overnight. We sat in the busy waiting room for a while, my partner was in obvious discomfort and scared. Her face had dropped very visibly and she felt embarrassed and uncomfortable. We waited and waited and waited for triage but after 40 minutes there was still no joy. People who came in after Us with minor ailments such as limps and sprains were seen before us. After seeing my partner in obvious discomfort, pain and distress, I decided to arrange for us to be picked up and taken to Luton Hospital. I felt this would be quicker than waiting at Milton Keynes. I am disgusted how a patient with a suspected stroke/TIA was asked to wait in the waiting room during the ""important hour"" . The paramedic who wheeled her through to the waiting room also showed their surprise.",1

She had fabulous care whilst in the Royal Blackburn hospital and together they support her to explore surgical intervention to see if she could regain her quality of life. She had a temp ballon procedure on Tuesday and initially recovered well. Unfortunately she did deteriorate and died on CCU on Wednesday pm. She died with all her family around her on CCU supported by the allocated nurse, Trini ward manager and doc TJ. They supported us and made my gran as comfortable as possible. The consultant Mr More came down to meet us.

251072,"My father was admitted to gade ward in March 2015 where he sadly passed away.. It was very under staffed and the some of the nurses that were on duty at this time had very little compassion which I personally found extremely sad. The end of life care was shocking and led to my father being left in a side room alone most of the time . I tried desperately to express that his behaviour was abnormal and I thought he was dying but this seemed to be dismissed and I felt very alone and totally unsupported.. After he passed away myself and sister came to see him, no-one on duty greeted us upon our arrival to the ward, no-one showed us to his room where he lay dead but most shocking of all was the state of his room ! His sheets were roughly thrown over his body, his urine bag was still hanging off his bed, rubbish and old cups from previous visitors and nurses rubbish littered the room. I hope the service and care that watford hospital provide will improve for pateints and their families in the future but for me the experience has left a lasting scar that will remain with me for life .",1

I highly recommend Southend Hospital in particular and the NHS in general. The many negative reports I read and hear about our health system do not reflect my experiences in any way, shape or form. We should be proud and appreciative of the service and the people who work in it.

This included a full assessment by the doctors and a consultant within hours. The staff in the unit were very reassuring in their professional approach and basic kindness.

I expressed my concerns over his mental health many times and have been put down many times. He was allowed to make decisions even though he did not realise the consequences of those decisions. However he has now died after contracting Pneumonia. His death certificate now says he had dementia! So , I was right all along. Much of his suffering could have been avoided if he had been diagnosed earlier. I have never seen anyone elderly suffer as much as he did and the Pneumonia was appalling and I think the shock of seeing him like that has taken my taste.I only hope that nobody else has to see what we have although I doubt if anything will change in the near future.

255473,Niece admitted to UCHL when her waters broke. Was kept in two days and then sent home. Ten days later felt baby moving about and went to the hospital two hours later only to be told that sadly the baby was dead. Baby delivered by C Section and was a beautiful little baby. When asked why the baby had died they told us that it was due to kidney failure as she did not have enough water. So why oh why did they send her home when her waters broke? We think the baby should have been delivered and put into an incubator. She was four weeks away from being full term. Baby buried beside husband's first wife and baby who died at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital due to acute septic even although she had green discharge and did not see a consultant for three days. It was the weekend and junior doctors were getting guidance BY TELEPHONE from their superiors. Yet another case of hospital error. When are these people going to be held accountable for their errors?,1
255882,"My mother was admitted with severe sickness just after Christmas. It was obvious to everyone except the staff that she had a serious illness. In hospital for four months without any diagnosis or effective treatment. All the while she stuck in bed, just lay there day after day. The only reply we ever had to our requests to her being moved and stimulated was that she didn't want to - she had dementia and had no control over her own mind. She was then sent to a nursing home and later readmitted with circulatory problems : no surprise really! Only when she was put on End of Life were we told that she had stomach and liver cancer. She was never ever diagnosed nor treated for this and we are left bereft and angry. She was bed blocking and they gave up on her because she had dementia. Our mam was let down by the system, she died on the 28th June 2015 aged 77. They put on her death certificate Dementia so there would be no comeback.",1
256175,"A excellent hospital medical staff are very good and the vascular surgery are very helpful in explaining the procedures for the risk involved in undergoing an operation. They take care and attention when asked questions regarding the surgery, and follower up with a excellent post operation service. The only complaint I have and this maybe a transition process is the re-appointment process. This could be because as the hospital was moving to a more efficient electronic appointment process, as there were hic-up in in the system. Further improvement could be made by using email as well keeping the telephone reminder service. In a number of instances the appointment letter was received after the appointment was made or on the day of the appointment.",0
256476,"Colchester General Hospital replied on 30 September 2015 I am extremely concerned by what you say in your email and would like to ask a colleague to look at the very serious issues that you raise. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could email your name, address, date of birth and daytime phone number to info@colchesterhospital.nhs.uk and quote ""complaint re refund on parking"" so that we can contact you to find out more. Please, please, get in touch. Thank you. Above is a very prompt reply to my concerns with the treatment I received from the General Office on the 7th September...I passed on my details etc and.on the 5th October I received a positive email from a person in the PALS department informing me that they had passed it over to the Facilities Manager to call me.......unfortunately they were just 'words' because it is now the 19th October and to date I have had no further communication !!!!!! I repeat that if you cannot address/resolve issues by picking up a telephone then what hope is there for patients !!!!!!",0
256509,"I wish to raise my families concerns about the care, or rather lack of, that my Mother is experiencing whilst an inpatient at Worcester Hospital. She was admitted recently and was placed in the MAU suffering from the same symptoms as an earlier admission some 2 years prior. Her notes from the previous stay were not asked for by the medical staff which if they had would have helped facilitate the diagnosis of her condition and the correct treatment, as a consequence she was put on antibiotics of a type that was well known by her family, GP and from her previous admission, do not work, she needed a superantibiotic administered intravenously, this was only commenced when pointed out by my sister that had they read mothers noted they would see that the antibiotic they were administering was ineffective, she was moved to a side room and there she lay for 9 days with no effort made by staff to keep her mobile, she was put on a catheter which was in far too long and stopped her motivation to help herself by taking away a reason to get out of bed, as a consequence she has retained water adversely affecting her legs and arms. After the infection in her blood was supposedly dealt with she was moved to Newtown Silver Rehab Assessment Unit where a perfectly lucid, sharp minded lady was placed on a ward with people with severe psychiatric problems which really affected her badly and upset her and the family greatly. My sister insisted mother be moved to a side room which was eventually allowed and she seemed to perk up only for the infection to return and she is back to square one and it appears that her bloods have not been taken for nearly a week which if they had would have showed the infection returning and without her knowledge a person with a history of low blood pressure was put on beta blockers resulting in her losing consciousness and a resulting blood pressure reading of 70/30, in other words she was perilously close to being killed by drugs being administered that considering her condition should never have been administered and failure to inform her of what was being done is disgraceful. All in all yet again, my mother has been a victim of poor assessment and treatment at Worcester Hospital.",1
256510,"This was my 2nd visit to this hospital. I phoned for x-ray appointment at 8. 30 offered a time of 10. 15. Brilliant. I thought that was quick. Anyway, my son said I will take you before work it will save you going on 2 bus trips. Left home 9. 00 I always like to arrive early. To my surprise speaking to reception staff (super lady), she said go down to x-ray department. Well, I just got to the seating outside and another nurse took me in, helped me with my coat shirt, and I could not have asked for better treatment anywhere. To cut a long story short, what super, polite staff. I was back sat in my sofa within exactly. 1 hour from leaving my home, a nearly 20 mile round trip. Now please to all the people who moan about our super NHS, read this. This is my personal experience, I cannot praise the staff I met highly enough, Thanks ladies' you know who you are! One very grateful OAP. Be lucky, keep smiling!",0
256980,My friend took me to A and E today when I awoke and had massive bleed. I had had a gyne procedure recently at Princess Margaret to remove polyp and biopsies taken. So was really worried to have massive bleed with clots. I was seen almost immediately and had several drs and nurses pop in on me whist I waited for gynocgologist to examine me. The gynocgologist was very kind and kept me informed on what was happening. Luckily bleeding calmed down and I was discharged home. I was treated with dignity and respect and a lovely nurse held my hand whilst I was examined. My friend was also allowed to sit with me most of the time.,0
257409,"From Consultants appt's through to operation & hospital stay. (April 2015 - Oct 2015) The care & service which I experienced was 100% :) All staff in looking after my treatment of care from pre-op to post-op were kind, cheery, friendly, helpful & very accommodating. They couldn't give enough Help & Support in looking after me or other patients within the Ward Bay area of which I stayed in. The Nursing Care was Exemplary ! Thank you to all that dealt with me. Thank you also to all the unseen staff on the Catering & Cleanliness of the hospital.

It was late at night and the nurse went and made him coffee, even though they were being abused by a very rowdy man. They treated an old man with dementia with kindness and respect, by doctors, nurses, the heart monitoring practioner. The nurse who glued his head was so gentle and kind to him even though it was painful for my dad she tried her very best to be gentle with him and treated him kindly. On we moved to EAU where Becky greeted us with open arms. My sincere grateful thanks to everyone who was involved.",0

258553,"I was admitted to ward 31 for one night which was enough, the staff over night were exceptional running around very busy never stopping but always chatty nothing was a bother. Until early morning when the ward sister came on duty they were utterly appalling, shouting at the poor staff it was disgraceful and totally humiliating for them poor nurses who had worked so hard over night and the ward sister treated them like dirt on their shoe no respect at all for their staff it's no wonder the NHS is short staffed if that's how the sisters talk to their staff.",0
258546,"I would advice you to review the way that you contact patients with regards to upcoming appointments. I received a txt msg informing me about an appointment that I had to attend. I had absolutely no idea what this was all about so when I called in the phone number provided to receive info, I was told that there was absolutely nothing in the system under my name and I made a mistake! Then all of the sudden I receive a letter that I missed an appointment and a new appointment is available for me. There is even a handwritten note that makes me even more confused about what this appointment is about . am I visiting the obstretics team or endocrine team. Very confusing not at all inspiring trust. You really need to review the way you contact patients or ensure your system is up to date so that when a patient contacts you, you can provide accurate details on the reason and status of his appointment",0
258710,"In October 2015, my mum was on Debenham Ward at Ipswich Hospital with bladder cancer. She suffered a stroke and began to decline. My dad who is 91 wanted to be with her until the end so he was at the hospital most of the day and night. The staff on the ward were phenomenal. Nurse Carey (I am not sure if I am remembering the name correctly) found a reclining chair for my father to use so he could sleep by my mother's bedside each night. He was dozing in that chair when my mother died. If there was leftover food, the housekeepers fed my father. One particular housekeeper, blonde with a big smile, really took care of him. Because of the support the ward offered my father, he remained physically strong and fairly well rested throughout this ordeal. Thank you!",0

259183,My husband and I phoned 111 after my 4 yr old Autistic son came out in a rash that looked like measles. They made us an appointment in the out of hours clinic. My husband went in first and booked in and explained to the receptionist that my son was waiting in the car as he was autistic and got distressed waiting in the waiting room. We didn't have to wait very long at all and the GP was brilliant. It was indeed measles he checked my son over he had an ear infection as well. He handled my son brilliantly as he was quite distressed. The GP then said if he had known he was autistic he would have seen him first. I just wanted to say thank you to that Doctor and receptionist as we usually have terrible experiences with Doctors and Nurses that don't understand Autism at all. They were brilliant and you put me and my husband at ease.,0

260003,"I found the visit I made to the dermatology department at Basildon Hospital this week provided me with an outstanding view of the available resources at this site. The staff attitude, compassion and overall professionalism I rate as conducive with an outstanding service that it is. Having worked in management myself, I understand the complexity and energy that is exercised in achieving such a superb department as this. The team work, the commitment of staff, I found, to be of the highest order and I wish to congratulate the management, and all staff in their professionalism and care. I also found that the future care, in my case, was fully well planned to enable me to cope with any on going problems.",0

Four days after as I write this the sight through my new lens in the left eye is clear and bright, Autumn colours have a new vividness. So thank you to my consultant and everyone that helped to make this procedure and process such a success. There were a lot of people not visible to me that had a hand in this I thank you all.",0
260158,"I know that many find Stepping Hill to be a good hospital but our dealings with it for the care of two elderly elatives have been very difficult. The latest concerns an elderly father who was admitted with a known uti after a bad fall. A&E diagnosed a pelvic fracture as well as the uti which was making him somewhat muddled and confused as uti'so tend to in the elderly. He was admitted for assessment of why he had fallen (he is over 90 and very unsteady on his feet) and for rest. When the ward was phoned early the next day, the staff nurse denied that he had a pelvic fracture and that he was being uncooperative due to his dementia. Visiting later and talking to another nurse, the fracture was confirmed and the confusion put down to his uti. It is not acceptable for those charged with the care of an individual to be unaware of the diagnosis which needs careful management and it is very presumptions to label someone as demented when they are unwell just because they are confused due to the illness. This is not the first time such failings have affected our parents at Stepping Hill. No way would I want to be admitted there.",0
260276,"Had an appointment on 6 November with the doctor at 4.15pm after less than 18 week wait. Transport to and from the hospital is slightly limited from Tonbridge so need a taxi, car or wait up to 30mins for the bus which is reasonably priced. Impressively new looking hospital with typical modern facilities. Signage slightly confusing for OPD as can either scan your letter or book in at main reception. Scanning worked fine though and good to have an electronic update screen showing who called through and any delays. Wait was 45mins extra though. No buzzers for people to get a coffee elsewhere while they wait although there are some screens in corridors showing when you're called through. Sub wait was also fine with water facilities but only a sprigel on the counter, no foam antibac dispensers. Consultant was very good getting a full history of the nose problem and going through a full examination inc a scope (which took watford 3 appts to do). Booked scan and given prescription in mean time. All staff were welcoming. These are my personal views and not of my employer.",0
260620,I had to enter a disabled badge on the machine in the highlands wing. 1. First of all why is that the only place in the hospital a machine is located? 2. The machine states press the button 3. The only button on the machine is a silver button on one side. 4. Press it and nothing happens. 5. The correct procedure is to press the screen !!! 6. Why does it not say that 7. Why is their not a cash machine in the hospital? When a patient is visiting a hospital it is stressful enough without this extra frustration Chase Farm I am sure you will agree is very confusing for patients with departments moving and the building works that are on site without this extra inconvienience. Have some consideration for your patients please.,0

260787,"Yesterday I visited the Day Clinic at Lincoln County Hospital, for a weekly venesection. I was informed a kindly person had donated £500 for the purchase of a large screen TV, for the ward (currently there isn't one). It would be a spot on acquisition for both patients and staff alike. The head of the department responsible for the installation of the appliance has stated it would cost £500 to install, citing the cost of wall fixing bracket, complete power rerouting and TV aerial. I know a bracket would cost cost £25.00 on Amazon. There are numerous 13 amp sockets in the immediate vicinity of the location of the TV. Use one of those (free). A good indoor aerial would cost £50.00 tops. Somebody is trying to make a fast buck here.",0
260897,"Through the screening programme, diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurism in September which required treatment and referred to Southend Hospital. An out-patient appointment followed by CT scan, pre-op assessment and subsequent admission and surgery followed all within a 6-week period. Fantastic service. On arrival for the OP appt check-in was simple using the electronic system, however, there were extremely helpful volunteers around to give assistance if needed. Instructions via the television screens when your patient number is called to move you into the next waiting area are straightforward and the signing in the hospital is very good. At each visit the experience has been equally good. I am completely impressed by the treatment received, the staff at all levels and the systems in place and highly recommend it.",0
261327,"Needed to have a Cardiology appointment- the only one to offer appointments within 66 days was Tameside. The referral from my GP to actual check up at Tameside was less than 2 weeks. The reception/ desk at Cardiology were both professional, welcoming and efficient. The appointment time 9.20 allowed me to be weighed etc and have an ECG- The consultant then saw me [with a sound knowledge of my case information] and we discussed my situation. I was initially rather concerned by the negative reviews but decided to go ahead so I could have a referral before February [66 days minimum] at a different hospital. Really impressed by the entire experience at Tameside Cardiology, would go again but hope I don't have to. Thanks to all the staff",0
261268,"Dear all, I would like to express my thanks to the team in A and E for their care yesterday (November 12th 2015) and in the AMRU init this morning (November 13th 2015). When I first came into A & E I was very efficiently dealt with and throughout the day saw 7 members of the nursing and physician team. I cannot praise highly enough their professionalism, concern, standard of care and sense of humour throughout my short visit. This was repeated by the staff in the AMRU unit this morning. As a patient nobody wants to go A & E but if you have to, from my experience you will be in the hands of a first class team. Thank you all again.",0
261367,Firstly they didn't listen to me about my illness and how it affects me as idiopathic intracranial hypertension varies from person to person. They never gave me my medication for 5 days which my partner stressed I needed four times daily as if I missed one dose it caused me to become ill drastically fast. The nurse said the hospital had none in stock and if he was that concerned about my health then he was to bring it in from home. He did but 2 days later. When my daughter came to visit she was disgusted to see how disoriented I was and withdrawn. To cut long story short the nurse had only lost my medication and had not been giving me my right medication. My daughters and partner were livid.,1
262158,"The new accommodation (November 2015) is a great improvement on the old small room that has been used in recent years in the other building. Clean, well decorated, plenty of room and seats, the replica fireplace in the corner is a nice touch, as is the large TV which was on with the sound off and subtitles on. We arrived at 1145hrs and waited only 7-8 minutes before being called to the well presented cubicle. As usual the staff were excellent, but unfortunately I was told that this excellent accommodation is only temporary and a further move is planned - just hope it is as good as at present, and the facility remains in North Lowestoft and not the JPH at Gorleston.",0
261722,"I have been attending Newton Abbot NHS hospital on a regular basis as an out-patient for over a year. The hospital is set in lovely surroundings with ample car parking facilities and a regular bus service from the town. The hospital is well designed and provides a tranquil environment that leads to a smooth and efficient organisation. This inspires patients to have great confidence in the treatments and therapies that these NHS facilities provide. The hospital is clean and quiet and all the staff that I meet in the different departments are both efficient and professional in their work . In particular the staff in the Podietry department are very kind, caring and consistent in the treatments that they provide . I have no hesitation in recommending both the hospital and it's dedicated staff to all future patients. Neil Armer",0
261752,"I just wanted to write how fantastic the elms practice GP surgery is (part of hayling island health centre), I think they really deserve positive feedback. The reception staff are all very friendly, helpful & kind (unlike other GP surgeries I've been registered with in other areas of the country). The way you are registered with one doctor who manages all your care and seem to really care about their patients works very well. Also the way you can have a same day telephone consultation with your own GP is brilliant. If my own GP is on holiday I have never had a problem getting an appointment if it's urgent with another GP. I also have to say that my own GP, Dr Goodhart, is the best GP I've ever met, he is patient, kind, very knowledgeable, caring and conscientious, all the qualities of a fantastic GP. The use of IT at the surgery is also excellent, I love that I can log on to patient. co. uk and request repeat prescriptions, book an appointment and view test results. The opening hours of the surgery are great with late appointments available on certain days of the week and reception opens at lunchtime (I've been registered with ones that don't and it makes it very hard if you work! ! ). The nurses and phlebotomists are also very friendly & kind and work hard to do a great job. All in all I cannot fault this practice at all, all GP surgeries should run like the elms practice, I feel very lucky to be registered with an outstanding GP surgery.",0
261903,"Be prepared for a three hour wait. A wait is always fine when you are informed of a delay and when approximately you may be seen. A wait is fine if there is access to water or food (coffee would be lovely). A wait is fine if the staff are pleasant. we waited for three hours to see a doctor with no explanation for the delay, without access to food or water and the initial rudeness of the reception staff was unbelievable. I am most usually a very tolerant, understanding person but today took the biscuit. Given a choice I would not come here again.",0
262574,The Trafford General Hospital Site Plan and Maps are USELESS! Map of area is geographically correct but should start with Moorside Road at the bottom not on the right hand side. I do not care where NORTH is! This is how people approach the hospital and it should begin at the bottom and lead out from that point. The so called site plan is USELESS. Trying to find Acute Medicine but not listed. No clear definition in graphic of departments and sub units. Go on the MRI site and all clearly shown and broken down in easy to follow and access site.

In all the difficulty I then missed typed one digit of my registration, I do not expect to receive a fine given that I have paid the fee and I will be interested to see just how such monies are being spent on patient care/ facilities.

Both my sister and I (I live 180 miles away in Wales) were on the ward visiting on Sunday and no information was given to us at all.

He was bed bound for 2 Weeks and has pressure sores, noone even thought to clean his dentures. This hospital appears disinterested in the care of elderly and dying people. I am shocked at the lack of dignity in how he was treated. The family will be making a formal complaint.",1
266441,"I went to see the consultant regarding migraines. I saw them at St Thomas. The consultant's appointments are always on time. The hospital staff are welcoming and polite. There are adequate facilities. The consultant is a great listener and seems to be a very calm person. The consultant is able to relate to migraine and is able to give suggestions on how to get the best from your medication and even suggest a few new tactics. the consultant seems up to date with the latest research , and promotes the use of new devices. I feel I could approach them anytime.",0
266850,"I went in for an operation on Monday 14th December 2015 in the morning at 07.30 and was operated on at 09.20. The staff were lovely, all the pre op work was efficient and timely and everything was under control. Before the op I saw the nurses, the consultant, their junior and the anesthetic team. The recovery team were great and I was drinking tea and eating toast by 12.00. I understand that some parts of the NHS may struggle at times but Broadgreen is excellent. Thanks to everyone from the person at the front desk right back to the consultant .",0
267216,"My father was rushed into the hospital on 14/12/15 approximately six in the morning , they saved my fathers life and I will always support this hospital staff . When he arrived at the accident and emergency they immediately checked him and diagnosed an heart attack , the specialist pulled me to one side and explained my father had an heart attack , and was rushed into theatre , and after was told he had the problem repaired with a stent , I after praise everyone from the ambulance and paramedics , I also after praise the doctors and nurses , that went out of their way to be helpful , what a credit these people are , thank you once again .",0
267486,My mother who suffers from dementia was admitted into the A&E Observation Ward overnight on the 17th December and was due to be collected the following day so my sister and I were pretty shocked to see that she had managed to walk out of the observation ward in her coat and nightgown and was waiting confused outside of the A&E department when we arrived to collect her. No harm was done and the medical attention both of the paramedics and the hospital staff who attended her for treatment was first rate but I would have hoped that a bit more care was taken regarding her security during her stay.,1
267557,"My daughter was accused of being a heroin addict by the safeguarding team. A drug test which my daughter consented to taking came up positive for opiates after eating poppy seed bread. Our family and particularly my pregnant daughter were put through complete and utter hell. It was claimed the only thing that could have caused a positive opiate test, other than illegal drugs was codeine. Ironically my daughter had been prescribed codeine for a painful condition she was suffering from at the time but hadn't taken it as she was worried about the effect on her unborn baby. She made the mistake of being honest by saying she hadn't taken the codeine. She genuinely had no idea what had caused the positive drug test. She was treated in the most disgusting way. We had to fight and do our own research to prevent my grandson being removed from my daughter at birth. We discovered it was the bread and that there was a test that would prove it wasn't heroin. We were told by one staff member that there wasn't. When we insisted and involved other medics the test was done. The same staff member lied and said the result proved it was heroin. We knew it wasn't so contacted the toxicology department ourselves. They confirmed it wasn't heroin, well we knew that. Both morphine and poppy seeds have exactly the same chemical make up and that was what the test came up positive for. This same staff member then insisted my daughter was a morphine addict. This person just wouldn't accept that she wasn't a drug user, even though she was clearly the picture of good health. I have never experienced anything like it! Obviously my daughter had stopped eating the bread so the drug tests were now coming back negative. This staff member then accused her of using someone else's urine for the test! We then had to insist a nurse supervised my daughter taking the test. Still they were insisting my daughter's baby would be removed at birth and placed in intensive care. At one point I had to argue with 4 different doctors. When I threatened to go to the papers they relented. When my perfectly healthy grandson was born and turned out not to be a heroin addict, we didn't even get an apology. After stress that I can't even describe!",1
267851,"vulnerable relative registered under mental health act, cruelly deprived of her relatives company and died half hour after I was forced to leave her bedside for no explicable reason apart from ""orders from above"". Awful care throughout 2 weeks in this hospital. Five hour wait for a doctor on a Saturday to re insert a cannula although she was at risk of dehydrating by constant vomiting . Aggressive nurse would not let me stay with her while they were washing her and when my sister cried out in distress they became even more aggressive with me for trying to check she was ok. We will always regret not simply discharging her from this hospital and taking her to another hospital or even just back home to her little dog.",1
267931,"Whilst visiting a sick relative on Ward D3 Spinal Unit, I was deeply disturbed by her experience on this ward. Half an hour before we arrived, she was experiencing severe stomach cramps and, as she is bedbound, asked for a bedpan. She was advised by the member of staff that they were too busy and it was a further half an hour after we arrived before she was provided with a bedpan. I then went outside the ward and witnessed an elderly, very infirm, male patient calling for help to go to the toilet. He said he had been pressing his buzzer for some time but no one came. I helped him to the toilet and then made sure he was okay to get back to his bed. I then returned to my relative who became increasingly distressed when recounting the treatment she had received in the previous days, including one occasion when her buzzer had been left out of reach and she spent an hour and a half calling for someone to bring her a bedpan as she was desperate for a wee. Having waited so long, the bedpan nearly overflowed and she was scolded by a nurse for getting urine on her nightdress. Despite having suffered ill health for nearly 50 years, my relative is the most courageous and dignified person I know and never complains. I am totally shocked by the level of care she has received from staff at Stepping Hill on this occasion. She admitted herself that she has never experienced such poor care and whilst we all know the pressures on the NHS, this is completely unacceptable.",1
269072,"Arrived at Willow Ward Reception at 10:35 on Tuesday 22nd December 2015. Five minutes early but no problem and formalities quickly dealt with and shown to clean, quiet and comfortable waiting room. At 10:40 more paperwork completed and then another short wait before being shown to spacious and clean changing room. A further wait but time to read the next chapter of current book before being shown to Endoscopy Unit presided over by the Consultant Urological Surgeon assisted by two other members of staff. Pleasant, spacious room and before I knew it, the Consultant was giving the all-clear and ""see you again in 12 months time"". Best news for a long while. Hope I can return to St. Cross in 12 months as it is a quiet, calm, clean and efficiently run hospital. Easy journey from Westwood Heath, Coventry and easy and reasonably priced parking. All credit to the whole Endoscopy Unit Team.",0
269889,"Popped down for an X-Ray (No appointment) and was processed, x-ray complete and on my way back home within 20 minutes! Fantastic friendly staff with a sense of humour and very professional. I couldn't believe just how clean the place was, I know hospitals are supposed to be, but the floor tiles look like they've just been paid they were that shiny. We are new to the area and I am used to the brand new Whiston hospital but this place just seemed more friendly and efficient. Thanks....",0
269828,"On behalf of my son, I called the Booking Office to cancel an appointment. During the course of the day (06. 01. 2016), I attempted to call the Booking Office 3 times. On each occasion I waited more than 20mins to get through and only on one occasion did I make it into number 10 in the queue - where sat for another 10 mins before hanging up. On your website (http: //www. surreyandsussex. nhs. uk/patients-visitors/outpatients/) - it states that I can request a callback once an agent becomes available. This function does not work. It further states that I can leave a message on the booking office phone outside office hours. This function does not work either. Rather than being a no-show for the appointment, I have made a significant effort to cancel the appointment to save the NHS precious resources. Having key functions that should help reduce waste not working is not contributing to this. FYI - we are generally very happy with the services we receive at the hospital.",0
270221,Absolutely disgusted with the care my auntie received she was extremely ill and they were more interested in freeing up the bed she was in and sending her home than they were on treating her or listening to what she was trying to say or relatives concerns regarding her being sent home! She was discharged and 2 weeks later and even more ill and emaciated and in a lot of pain was taken back via ambulance. When I stated how ill she was to a member of the surgical team I was told that if she was their mother they would make out she was dying too! All because my auntie is quiet and always smiles her pain was over looked needless to say 4 hours later she was on hdu!!! Poor communication and more worried about saving money in my opinion than treatment they dealt with the symptoms but not the problem...It took a second opinion and referral to another hospital for my auntie to receive the life saving treatment she needed,1
270219,"I was both delighted and impressed with my care in the Cardiology Unit at Pinderfields . Swift diagnosis using the latest equipment . A clear explanation of the problem found and a detailed discussion as to the options for treatment . The treatment , a pacemaker was quickly arranged , the procedure itself went well and the aftercare has been excellent . The Cardiology Dept seem to enjoy their work & a real team spirit seems to exist . Everything from the easy car parking , clean ward & helpful staff put one at ease . I was given the choice of other hospitals by my GP but am glad I chose Pinderfields . Well done to all concerned .",0
270324,"Appointment made for 09:20 and arrived at 08:55. Car Park looked busy but found a slot easy enough. £2.70 for 2 hours was reasonable enough. Booking in on the digital screen was easy and the reception staff also made sure I knew where to go. I was seen @ 09:15 by the consultant, who suggested some blood tests and X-rays, which they booked there and then. Bloods were taken by a busy bloods department. I was 10th in the queue but seen within 10 minutes. X-rays were completed within 20 minutes of arrival. Staff in all departments were 1st class. All-in-all a great experience with every department running like clockwork. I was back in the car before 10:15, which considering what I had done was quite impressive. If you get a choice of hospital for your consultancy, I highly recommend you choose Chapel Allerton, I know I will again. Well done to the whole team.",0
270412,After years of abdominal pain my relative has still not had a diagnosis... each time he comes to A&E he is given paracetamol and occasionally has been admitted to a ward but yet continues to get discharged without investigations . Here we are again and still the clinical staff are not taking symptoms seriously. Every couple of weeks the paramedics are called as he is rolling around in agony.... to add insult to injury some of his notes have gone missing! On one occasion he was discharged and a relative went to collect him only to find he was rolling around in agony on the pavement outside A&E. This would not happen to an animal so why is this happening to a grown man ... we just praying that there is nothing more serious being missed due to neglect of a patient considering we have already lost close family relatives to cancer recently.,1
270602,"My elderly and fragile Dad was admitted to A&E by ambulance last Wednesday morning 6th January. He was really struggling to breathe and presenting with a severe infection. He was treated with kindness, respect and dignity. His medical needs were attended to promptly. Due to a shortage of beds in the hospital he spent all day in A&E, this was not a problem for us as his care was exemplary whilst in there! He was then admitted to the Frailty ward where the nurse was responsive and friendly. The next day he was transferred to another ward. I would have liked to have been told that the Frailty ward was likely to be a temporary place to be cared for! The next day the family arrived to visit and he wasn't on the ward at all - always an emotive experience, He moved to a Huntsman ward where again the care has been exemplary. I am very grateful to all the staff as they are trying so hard to empower my father to recover, despite the odds!",0
272487,My eeyesight is deteriorating with early stage glaucoma. My review appointment was changed to November and then cancelled without explanation. I phoned up two months later to hear that there is a staff shortage and appointments have been cancelled. No current prospect for a new appointment. Previous service very good and helpful. There is no mention of staff problems or delays on the website. Do I need to ask my GP for a referal to a different hospital? Am I the only person affected - I doubt it? If there is already a 2 month delay a lot of other patients may be affected. Information please. This Review format does not seem to include delays and cancellations which are more serious issues than some of the rating factors invited on this page. This comment is for a specific problem - not rating the hospital overall.,0
272613,"Had cataract operations in September (right eye) and November 2015 (left eye) and very successful. Was surprised at how short a time (5 weeks) I had to wait for the first op once I had seen the consultant. My long vision has improved, eg, can now go round the supermarket without glasses. Due shortly to collect a new pair of bifocals – whilst most of the time, I could manage without glasses, I would prefer my vision to be the best it can be. I found the Consultant and all staff caring, kind and cheerful. Many thanks to you all for excellent service.",0
271289,"In April my god mother was diagnosed with a brain tumour. In early May, she was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary under the care of Mr Kumar for surgery. Sadly complications arose which meant that she was to remain in hospital care until early July. During this time Mr Kumar arranged for her to be transferred to Bradford Royal Infirmary to make visiting easier on myself and other relatives. It became evident that my god mother was terminally ill, however without a diagnosis we were unable to move forward. Mr Kumar kept in constant contact, and in early July took her back to Leeds General Infirmary to carry out a further biopsy. Sadly the result was as expected, however without Mr Kumars help my godmother would have died in hospital without a diagnosis. His persistence meant that we could make the most of the time that my godmother had left, which she spent out of hospital. For this, we are all truly grateful.",0

How can they miss with all my symptoms I had the life threatening illness, they just left me in the bed without any help other than pain killers but that wasn't taking the pain off so they should of known it was a kidney stone",1

272056,"Unfortunately I have had the misfortune to visit this hospital a number of times with my elderly father and elderly mother in law and have been very disappointed with the whole procedure. Last night I had to take my Father to hospital after an incident which was not life threatening but did need medical attention given his other problems. I took him to Rake lane hospital first where he was seen but not examined at all, I was then told to take him to Cramlington where we had over 4 hours wait. There were a lot of people on trolleys in corridors and 12 ambulances queued up outside waiting to come in, where we sat there was no real emergences sitting there, it included homeless, drunk and people who just felt ill. What I don't understand is why you are sent from one hospital to another when it is clearly not an emergency?",0
272138,"This truly is a centre of excellence for hip replacements. The surgeon and team, plus all support staff are very personable, highly skilled and professional people. I am a double hip replacement patient that cycles, hikes mountains, swims and loves nothing better than an adventure. My surgery has allowed me to continue with this life style :-). My personal advice to those thinking of having hip replacement surgery here - is the care and skill is brilliant but you need to go with an open mind, be positive and try anything. On both occasions I even found the catering to my liking, well with a few extra treats from home. To sum it up - in my opinion, a centre of excellence!",0
272286,"Trying to get through to the physiotherapy department is impossible. The numbers given ( 020 8274 6847 / 020 8274 6828) go to an answering machine which says 'due to high volumes of calls our lines are very busy so we cannot take your call, visit our website where you can fill a form to contact us'. What if you are elderly and do not have access to a computer? The main switchboard puts you through to the same numbers which gives the same unhelpful message. This problem has been going on for a year!!! Had the same issue last year and the reason given was that the whole department had gone on a 2 day course! The Manager should phase training so that the phones are manned at all times. Why should patients have to call PALS to complain and leave a message. Is anyone at Croydon University Hospital interested in improving this service? Please do not offer the excuse of problems with phone lines or all staff on training - this is wearing a little thin!",0
272439,"I visited minor injuries last night after falling and cutting my head open. I was bleeding quite a lot feeling dizzy and extremely sick.. The receptionist was extremely blunt to my husband on the phone and on arrival to the department..when I was seen by the nurse they extremely uncaring cold and abrupt..I remained calm and polite throughout my consultation even when they scrubbed at my wound appearing to be unaware or unfeeling to me wincing and crying as they carried out their 'care' procedure. I am very aware that the nurses are under pressure as I was a nurse myself, and so would not of attended hospital unless I felt necessary ' I am not a time waster' My wound resulted in being glued as I had sustained quite a considerable cut and so feel I was right to go to minor injuries but unfortunately due to my care I certainly will not attend by choice the Samuel Johnson again ! Extremely poor patient care .",0
273977,This comment is about waiting times for appointments. I was referred by my GP on November 27th for a DEXA Scan. To date l have yet to receive an offer of an appointment 62 days following referral ( average waiting times recorded as 22 days on the web site). In spite of several attemts to contact the department l have been unable to speak to anyone about this and find out where l am on the list. Today l contacted my GP practice and was told they had received several complaints about the same issue. My referral will be re faxed with a note attached. Although l am not unsympathetic to the pressures of managing referals to have received no offer of an appointment after this lenght of time is unacceptable.,0

His care and treatment yesterday was some of the best he has received and we are very grateful for everything that was done. Believe it or not, he is well enough to leave hospital today!",0
274845,"My mother arrived at 3am struggling breathe was told 5 hour wait, she couldn't wait. Went home got worse and called an ambulance. When she arrived she was told that coming in on an ambulance didn't mean she would be seen any quicker. She waited for 3 hours struggling to breath and was never once offered oxygen. They did take bloods and the doctor left her for 20 minutes with a tourniquet on. She was sent home saying she had a virus with no medication. Later she got even worse so went to her GP who reviewed the earlier bloods immediately recognised a bacterial infection and had her admitted to ENT at Freeman where she still is on oxygen, fluids, antibiotics and adrenaline to stop her throat from closing up due to an infection near her larynx. From a specialist emergency care hospital I have little faith that they knew what they were doing since when my mother (a former ENT nurse) suggested a Quinsy the doctor then went and GOOGLED it to find out what she meant.",1

I've just telephoned the department and they were very helpful and gave me some handy hints for next time (March 2016) I need to drink 2 litres of that horrid-tasting gloop. The information leaflet is quite detailed about colonoscopy procedure but only tells patients to drink 2 litres: once then another 2 litres a couple of hours later. The handy hints are terrific, involving ice cold water / a small glass / a straw / flavouring / etc. Imo, they deserve praise for going the extra mile and I hope you will recommend the handy hints be incorporated in the colonoscopy information leaflet.

My husband had lost three stone in weight and was so weak he could hardly walk. He was breathless, had a nasty cough, and stomach pain.

They said no he's a grown man he'll be fine. My daughter was instructed to come back in an hour, it was 2 hours later before he came out and was in deep distress when he got in the car.

Examination completed by a very proficient practitioner, I was out of the hospital within 20 minutes.

The hospital itself is well maintained and the ongoing improvements to the general layout and signage are making it easier to find your way around. Without hesitation, I would recommend AGH.",0
285173,"My daughter was taken to A&E by ambulance unconscious after having her drink spiked. She was left alone in the A&E waiting area from midnight to 04:00 before being seen by a doctor. After which she remained in the waiting area. In the morning, the doctor discharged her without taking her vital signs, and without having anyone to accompany her home. She did not want to leave as she still left sick and faint. They pushed her to get a taxi. As she left the hospital she collapsed and had to be helped back into A&E by a passer-by. At 9.30 she was given anti-vomiting medication and told to leave. I do not live in Brighton and was concerned as my daughter had been hospitalised. I did not know which hospital she had been taken to. When I called Brighton County, they had not record of her. I called round all the other hospitals in the surrounding area, to no avail. When I called the County back, I could not get through to A&E. Fortunately a friend of my daughter knew she was at the County and although the staff also told her my daughter was not there, she insisted they check. They then found her.",1
281682,"I was very impressed with the efficiency - I phoned at 8.30 to check x-ray timings (I couldn't find this information on the website); the phone was answered promptly and politely. I arrived at 9.10 and was back out by 9.20! My only criticism is that the centre is used for so many purposes the signage isn't very clear - I would expect 'x-ray' to be clearly signed, but I couldn't see it anywhere. However reception staff were very helpful and polite. Overall a very good, efficient and friendly service that I recommend. And no parking charges!",0

Nan arrives at karensa ward in trelisk and had her prescription morphine withheld from her because she was told there was only one doctor there allowed to dispense it. She spent her evenings having other patients messing on the floor next to her bed whilst staff members were nowhere to be seen.one staff member took my nans buzzer from her! Disgusting treatment considering this ward is for elderly, vulnerable people. Something needs to be done. Elderly people or anyone for that matter,should not have the prescriptions withheld or buzzers. I wouldnt allow an animal to be left here, let alone a human.",1
280748,"I attended for a knee replacement. Perfectly comfortable stay. All staff caring, helpful and pleasant. They worked hard and didn't waste a moment. No problems with anything except the meals: Plenty of (white) over-cooked pasta provided. So over-cooked it resembled wall-paper paste. No sugar free choices for breakfast, Plenty of sugary cereals. No marmite for the (white) toast but plenty of jam and marmalade. No wholemeal bread. Timing of final meal so late, I had to skip it or have indigestion all night. So glad to be home. Don't they know about dietary recommendations? Does anyone ask why so much food has to be thrown out?",0

They even called up after there shift had finished to see how I was. I suffered a miscarriage a few months later and again they were amazing. A few months later I found I was pregnant again.my consultant and all the staff were amazing again, they saw me and spoke to me on the phone as often as I wanted and did all they could to calm my nerves.my son harry was born safely and I couldn't have done it without all the fabulous staff.

280804,I attended a gender identity workshop in February 2016 and was very impressed with the afternoons presentation. The presentation was held in the lecture hall by the team of clinicians who used slide shows to inform us of the theory and overview of the process followed by a technical explanation of the medical procedures we could expect and the outcomes. It was delivered in an honest way with good humour. I felt encouraged that I will eventually receive world class leading tretament. You could see the dedication and enthiusiasm of the team. The reception was well organised and i was happy to be greeted with my new name. I am looking forward to my first GIC appointment.,0
280986,"I have three letters for my sons hearing appointment cancelling the previous letter and giving another time, the last letter reinstates the original appointment. when I try phoning to confirm which date and time he needs to attend no-one answers the phone, the voice message service is full and the call terminates. Ringing the main reception results in 30 minutes of dreadful music and being ignored, so there is no way to discover which appointment is valid. This isn't about funding it is basic administration and call handling, which if done properly in the first place would save staff time, patient time and hospital money. I notice that none of these reviews have an answer, which is a perfect example of the managments commitment to proper administration and communication.",0
280903,"My brother @ mother visted A@E on Sunday 28th Feb 2016. The way my mother was spoken about is NOT acceptable. She asked a nurse about waiting times was told they are busy. As she walked away she heard the nurse say to another colleague well what do u expect she's thick Irish she didn't confront nurse but told my brother about incident. They were called a while later by another nurse was told where to go so asked where to go. Told oh just get in there. once in room my bro was standing by bed my mum said to my brother get on the bed. my brother said nurse had gone to get sheet to put on bed came back without sheet then accused my mum of swearing & been rude as she spoke to my brother. Nurse said to mum well explain to my brother about situation & help him on bed like his mentally retarded because he has vast facial disfigurement & is partially sighted he has no problems understanding talking explaining etc My bro was in quite alot of pain & discomfort was trying to ask dr about his symptoms & causes. Was told busy muttered something yawning nurse said don't have time for this nonsense, weren't listening walking away talking to other colleagues. The Nurses my mother and brother came into contact with were very rude ignorant treat people with disabilities disgustingly talking about them instead of to my brother. Assume his mentally backward. don't want to help people. see disabled people as a nuisance have no time for them Said my brother was rude. well don't walk away when he is asking about treatments etc. the nurses Dr on duty have a obligations to care for my brother not push him aside. Listen to what he is asking to care isn't hard that's their job. I appreciate staff Drs busy but that's no excuse to treat my family members like that.",0
280975,"In Summer 2015 I was admitted following two failed attempts to 999 to get an ambulance to hospital. When I eventually called my GP to call one on my behalf I was taken to Sunderland and diagnosed with very low potassium. I was placed on an ECG and given two IV bags to sort it out. However during this time I was extremely anxious and having hallucinations, a painful stomach with radiating pain throughout the body, constipation and high anxiety levels/panic attacks. The doctors in the hospital totally ignored all of the symptoms of mental illness whilst I was being treated. Once my potassium was back to normal I was strong armed by the doctor on duty to sign the discharge papers. I explained to the doctor that I was really not myself and was afraid, I said to the doctor that if the symptoms I am feeling are not really happening, then I wanted them to place me in a mental health ward so they could diagnose the issue because I was extremely concerned at the time that I had many physical ailments which were being ignored by this doctor. The doctor refused and I said that if it got worse, I would only be back again. So I signed. Later that evening I had extreme symptoms, extreme anxiety, what appeared to be a seizure in my legs followed by loss of sensation. I was taken back to hospital, by this point the feeling had mostly returned (but the ambulance crew witnessed the shaking in my legs). The doctor did not wish to keep me in hospital and refused to forward me to any mental health teams. Early the next morning I had what can only be described as a psychotic episode, I was hallucinating heavily seeing blood (which was not there), convinced that my organs were going to explode or something terrible. More extreme pain, hyperventilation. I did some very scary things thinking I was fighting for my life - I should have been kept in hospital. My disabled mother witnessed the episode and was distraught, had no idea what to do. I thought the hospital would ignore me again but figured that since there was blood everywhere (in my mind) that this time, surely they would take my concerns seriously. So we called 999 again, but this time went to the QE in Gateshead, who quickly diagnosed hallucinations, a UTI, constipation and liver toxicity. I was given a laxative, diazepam and a coarse of antibiotics. I took me about 2 months to feel normal again. Sunderland hospital completely missed these issues and ignored me when I returned to hospital. Their provision for mental health is abysmal and could cost some seriously ill people their lives. I literally begged the doctors there to help me, and their only answer was, ""You are not showing signs of acute illness and we will not admit you to the hospital"". Mental health of this nature absolutely is acute and it was extremely dangerous to ignore the symptoms I was presenting, especially when I wasn't aware that I was suffering from mental illness at the time, the doctors at the hospital should have known better.",1

282229,"I had to attend the hospital on Saturday evening with my father who is in a wheelchair, has COPD, Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. My father, who lives in Res Care, had an infected finger and we were advised by the nurses who were called to the home to take him to hospital. We waited 3 hours to be seen by a doctor who gave my father some antibiotics. My concern is that there is no consideration given to elderly patients, my father is 86, who have Alzheimer's, he sat for 3 hours in a wheel chair. Could patients with Alzheimer's be treated earlier than other patients with minor complaints? Over a year ago I attended with my mother who also had Alzheimer's, she was mobile and needed to walk all the time, luckily we were accompanied by a carer from her home. My mother had Lewey Bodies so she could be disruptive. It was late at night and my mother kept asking for something to eat and I eventually had to ask other people waiting if they had anything, luckily one woman had some biscuits. I am sure that my mother's behaviour must have irritated some people who were feeling ill. My mother at that time looked very old, and frail she must have weighed about 6 stone - again could elderly people please be seen before those with minor complaints?",0

I checked the Internet using an alternate number and every time I reached the William Harvey X ray department the phone is answered, and they put the phone down on me (mainly around 12:30pm Thursday). The reason for wishing to cancel my Friday, 11 March 2016 appointment is because after a very long wait my appointment was double booked, one at the William Harvey the other at the new Whitstable Health Centre, which I have recently attended. I wish to bring to your attention the incompetence, the rudeness and general inefficiency surrounding this early stage of my health problem. The form below does not allow the selection of the Xray department....",0

After trying to get pregnant for more than 2 years, and having various tests, the next test is this xray of fallopian tubes, uterus and womb, it is a sensitive and stressful time and now I have to wait 3 months for an x-ray - if I can get through to Whipps Cross in the first place I have been calling the Xray department for 3 days, 30 calls a day and the telephone line calls then just goes through to a full voicemail box. This is unacceptable that I can't even book an appointment and have to spend all my time between two jobs to sort this out then potentially wait a further 3 months for an appointment.

I am currently # 1 in the queue (3rd time I've called today, and currently on hold for 50 mins), which implies 1 of 2 things, 1) staff are spending a very long time dealing with one person's problem, or 2) they are short staffed and someone has taken a very long break.

The first time (the day of the stroke) it took me over 30 minutes to park, & then I parked in the wrong place. Coming to hospital is stressful the best of times, & even more so when you're coming for urgent life-saving-help! Signs direct me to one of the several car parks, but when I actually go to enter at the barrier, they seem to then say that they are for staff-only ! What moron devised this system ? And why has something still not been done to solve these basic problems? Also: The way the car-parks are laid out is ridiculous, & the sign-age is nonsensical; One large car park with one or two ways in & out would make much better use of the available land, enabling many more cars to park, & making it much easier & faster to find a car space, & thereby much less stressful . You are quite happy to charge (& fine) people to park here, isn't it about time you used that money to provide the service that we are supposed to be receiving, & which has already been paid for by the tax payers, when the place was built ! Before we leave the EU: Perhaps you should spend some of the huge Europe budget to solve this problem, rather than waste it on none urgent & unneeded projects ?!

284620,My elderly mother who is 76 years old tried to get an appointment at her GP's but was told that they had no appointments for 2 weeks and that she should go to Barking walk-in centre. After waiting for an hour this morning my mother was not seen by the doctor and was told to that she did not have a minor injury so she should go back to her GP. My mother has been suffering from a very irritable skin problem for a while now and nothing that the GP has given her has helped. I am confused as to why she was not seen and why she was fobbed off. I can see from the reviews that this is not just a minor injury unit so why was an elderly patient who is obviously suffering being treated this way. It's a disgrace!,0

They are honest and will say if they do not know the answer to your question , and will do their best to find out answers for you - they also call you back with those answers. The situation I am in is very emotional and it is so reassuring to have such professional people supporting me. Thank you to all of them .",0

He had suffered an allergic reaction to his eyes and both eyes were swollen and closed making it very difficult to see. The person on the desk may have thought his eyes were swollen because he had been fighting or not taken him seriously because of his age, either way I don't feel it is appropriate that someone made this judgment and sent him away without any advice on where he could obtain treatment. If the allergic reaction had affected his mouth or airway there may have been a more serious outcome. He did receive treatment at Blackburn later yesterday evening and the swelling is now reducing. I have previously attended this hospital and always found the staff helpful and therefore I am surprised that he was turned away in this way",1

From nurses that were unsupportive to doctors and consultants making dangerous decisions regarding my child's care with out even knowing very much about his history which has resulted in him being put back in a very dangerous place. The amount of medical staff on site is dangerously low. I have seen nurses and doctors not wash there hands when treating premature babies as well as other unclean practices.

I have to guess as to which is car park 'A', ie the suggested parking on the web site, but not annotated on the map. I have to guess the main reception and where to go for Hutchings. This having to guess would be removed if the appointments gave a department that the web site states, or the web site gave a list of wards, followed by a link to directions from a stated entrance that is then annotated on the map along with the nearest car park that is available.

Other nurses were rude and sarcastic with her. What has happened to compassion on these wards?

Initial star ratings posted on the interiors of the antenatal unit worried my partner, as it was rated very poorly. However, our experience to date has been fantastic. I've attended the initial 12 week scan, 20 week scan, gynaecology appointments and an additional growth scan. Each time the reception staff have been very friendly and answered any questions I had. The wait time was also reasonable - I arrived 10-15 minutes in advance of my appointed time, and only ever waited up to 15 minutes after my appointment time. In fact for my 20 week scan - the moment i checked in with reception, i was whisked in for the scan - 10 minutes early! The staff have been professional and accommodating - if you ask for scan pictures to take home, they try their best to get a good picture for you! The scans felt comprehensive with staff providing explanations as they proceeded. The waiting areas and toilets are clean and bright. There are vending machines for snacks and water fountains (you need to ask reception for a cup). I plan to have my baby at this hospital, so will provided a new review in a month's time!",0

She was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer at Broomfield hospital who were convinced the cancer had originated in her uterus, we were not. The consultant at Broomfield hospital told me that if the cancer was in the uterus they would not offer her any more treatment. To say I was devastated is an understatement. Anyway, now to the good bit....Ipswich hospital breast care team picked up the ball and ran with it, my daughter was seen by a wonderful Mr. Linder AND equally wonderful Miss Mortimer who offered her a hysterectomy and mastectomy and reconstruction under one anaesthetic, we were overjoyed.

So the nurse wheeled him in the middle of the bay and left him, and let everyone in the bay look at him cry, When I arrived I was mortified, my dad wasn't fed properly and lost so much weight it was pitiful, we fed dad when we went to visit which was everyday for seven weeks until we asked to take him home as they said he was basically going to die and they couldn't really say what of and stopped treating him.

291737,"I have had hell for 9 months after a fall. Passed from pillar to post in Chester and left feeling inhuman Referred to Walton and then Aintree with a broken back. One of the doctors I saw..unbelievable compassion and honest care. Nothing too much and so caring. Another doctor was such a professional beautiful caring human being The nurse in the fragile care unit, words cannot describe the genuine compassion this nurse has. Nothing a problem to them. I have to say that after being wrongly diagnosed with a broken back and eventually being put in the safe hands of Aintree I have had faith restored. Thank you Aintree. You are amazing",1
290581,"My Mother was taken into East Surrey hospital on the 31st March suffering a severe stroke. She was 90 years old. She was attended to quickly with kindness and we were kept very well informed. She was moved to Chaldon (stroke) Ward. She never regained her speech or movement in her left side. She eventually suffered from an internal bleed and passed away. The last two weeks of her life, my mother was cared for with such care, compassion, respect, professionalism and good humour that I was totally humbled. I stayed with her in her room for the last week of her life. The Doctors, nurses and entire team looked after my needs and supported and our whole family beyond anything we could have reasonably expected. I cannot thank the team enough for being there in every respect when my mother's life ended.",0
290953,"To begin with, the latest CQC report (2014) is 'requires improvement', not 'good' as suggested by the NHS choices site. Currently complaining so will avoid specific details, but we are very dissatisfied with: Maintenance and communication of medical records Ward management Clinical supervision Care planning and monitoring Feedback on progress of care plans Continuity of care and communication/handover amongst care teams Communication with patient and carers Medicines management and safety Delegation of tasks to non-clinical staff, eg taking blood samples Understanding of needs of elderly patients with multiple health conditions Appropriateness of language and attitudes of some nursing, care-assistant and ancillary staff Responsiveness to concerns and complaints Etc There are so many concerns I would actively warn against using these services without rapid, evidenced improvement. If you or your family have to use these services make sure a named, senior person at the hospital takes responsibility for the care plan, explains it to you, monitors it and keeps you up to date and convinces you of the benefit and safety of every element of it.",1
291005,I have a member of my family staying at New Cross for a period of just over 2 weeks-to aide her recovery it is important that they have access to as much 'normality' as possible - the virtual world being part of that. I checked on their website and it stated there and states on this website that there is wifi available for SU - this is not true. I rang their IT provider and spoke to a member of staff who was very disengaged and simply said we don't provide this service to SU but we may in the future - in response I asked them to remove this info off the website - to which they weren't the slightest bit bothered about. This concerns me as in this new world on commissioning I would assume that all staff whether clinical/non-clinical would have great customer service skills and that organisations would try and provide a service where people do feel at home and can access the outside world-simply not impressed!,0

Despite being very busy I was taken in very quickly and after blood test the consultant said I was severely dehydrated with a serious pneumonia infection on my right lung. A drip and intravenous antibiotics were immediately done. I was admitted in ward H4 a few hours later where the staff looked after me so well: from the nurses to the doctors, despite being extremely busy! Scanners and MRI were performed rapidly. Dr Schreiber was amazing and took the time to show me the X-ray with my lung infection. She explained so well and performed a lumbar puncture so professionally: there was no pain and I had every faith in her abilities! I can only commend all the caring staff: so professional, despite being too busy!",0

292065,"My 7 year old son was taken by ambulance to New cross, he had an acute asthma attack and was given a nebuliser by the paramedics, which helped him greatly. They felt he needed to be seen by a doctor as his oxygen levels were low and he was being sick. We got there, the paramedic waited for the receptionist to look at them for 15 minutes, they were ignored while trying to book my son in, they found him a chair as no one was interested, we were ignored. Finally, they asked about my son, no one looked at him, he was being sick and was left while I had to sort him out. We were then taken to a waiting room and left for over 2 hours, in all that time not one person checked he was ok, I am disgusted. I left and went to my own doctor who gave him steroids as his wheezing was so bad. I will never go there again. They just don't have the time to care.",0

We waited hours in casualty hallway before he was seen on a trolley. When he was eventually see he had a diagnoses and I was told that he was very poorly since then I have gone from Major to Minor?? I have been given so many different prognosis! Its worrying enough when an elderly relative is taken into hosp anyway. Why cannot us as relatives be told the truth, drs knowing what medication and listening to what they are being told and not looked at as if you are an idiot. Then to be put in a ward and still told by one person that its serious and then being told it is not, being told patient is going to be discharged and then cannot be discharged because still ill and still in this place.Then to cap it all by being told no visitors because of norovirus, so why are we stopped from seeing our vulnerable relatives who are scared of what is going on. Why has every ward not allowed visitors because this hospital cannot control cross infection? I think its appalling and I truly hope that I never go into this hospital I truly do.",1

Her medical history fully explained to the triage nurse was eventually seen by a doctor. She was in great pain he told her she had gastric enteritis and discharged approximately 3 weeks later after taking her back to queens she died. I think if she had been seen earlier, she may not have died. I believe she should have been admitted when she first went to A and E.

When the midwives visited her at home the next day, they told her she was not far off a heart attack. She was blued and two-ed back to Barnet. She had six blood transfusions.

It's since been cancelled and I was given an appointment with a specialist's registrar, but this appointment is one week later. By the time I see the consultant it will be over 18 weeks' pathway, which just seems to go by the window without much care or thought in the world for the patient. I tried to email the consultants secretary tonight to find out what the hell is going on, their email address is advertised next to the name, yet the email keeps bouncing back saying the email address is restricted, so why have the thing on the website if it won't take emails from patients, I don't expect the exchange of clinical information, but exchange of information between the secretary and the patient.

This includes all the staff from all the other departments involved in my treatment such as the X-Ray, MRI and the ultra sound team, through to the theatre staff, doctors and consultants..and the hospital worked well out of hours and over the weekend too.

I subsequently slipped into a coma, my family being told there was no hope but critical care brought me through. They were brilliant! I then spent time in cardiac care, were again they kept me alive even when my lungs collapsed and my heart valve failed. Following this, I was moved to B12 and this ward was absolutely Magic. The care medical and personal was better than I could ever have hoped for from the sisters to the cleaner they did a superb job and I am sure I owe my life too all three of these wards and will be eternally grateful.

293819,"My uncle has been in critical care for about a month now after his bowl ruptured and he had to have an ileostomy. He was ventilated after surgery and the staff had trouble waking him up off the ventilator so a tracheotomy was done. He was woken up and doing well until he stared having episodes of uncontrollable fast breathing causing his heart rate and other things to race up. this keeps resulting in the staff sedating him again. The staff are puzzled to what is causing this after doing many tests and x rays and finding nothing. However when he is awake he keeps telling us it happens, then the staff do the suctioning procedure. It put him in awful pain and the staff are very rough despite being told to be gentle. He has also worn a red band around his wrist warning that he is allergic to penicillin since he was admitted. However we have been informed today that he is 'not in fact allergic to penicillin as he has been on it for 5 days with no reaction' but he has had diarrhea and breathing difficulties, which I am now thinking could be due to the penicillin he has been given. I don't know whether it's because the staff on critical care are used to dealing with sedated patients but it seems like they aren't listening to him or us and are really rough when turning him an doing suction. He was also given a speaking valve not long after he was woken up but after being sedated the first time the valve has not been given back to him. It seems they are sedating him the first chance they get. I feel that they don't give him chance to calm these episodes himself first. As he has calmed himself down before and they have sedated him anyway. I am worried he is not been cared for properly.",1
294474,"I think the NHS is FANTASTIC, the 8th wonder of the world. However, I do have a small gripe (and I do feel bad about moaning about it) but I think its more of a management and resources issue than anything else. I have regular 3 month appointments at the MRI to manage an chronic bowel condition. Because of the medication I'm on I'm required to have blood tests at each appointment. Sometimes these can be very smooth, however its not unknown for the wait to be as much as 1. 5 hours, which in addition to the 45 minute wait for a 10 minute appointment means I am often spending the entire afternoon in the hospital for a 10 minute consultation. (I don't really want to moan because I know the staff do their best and are wonderful) But maybe a detailed, honest explanation of why the wait needs to be so long could be printed and posted on the wall next to the ticket machine where you get your number?",0

The attitude and patience of all the staff from Reception to final discharge was above reproach. With the influx of patients on this particular evening the attention to my case was very impressive.

We understand it was busy but they didn't seem to agree on the certain processes. My sister and her husband were seen and had the scan which confirmed the miscarriage and were upset as you do. However, she was shock how rude the doctor was who saw her after the scan. The doctor had a go at her for not having a smear test earlier and said she's putting the baby at risk. I know doctors are there for our well being but my sister had a miscarriage and the doctor were not sympathetic and felt as if they're blaming her for the miscarriage. They found the doctor rude despite they are very upset. However they said the other staff such as nurses and junior nurses were very helpful and caring.",1
295292,My daughter has just telephoned me after a 4 hour major operation after she was told she could go home. Her blood pressure was 90/40 and that seems acceptable by their standards. No monitoring her condition until blood pressure returns to normal. How this hospital continues to be used I will never know. Other disasters at this hospital have been: my grandson was told the pain he was suffering was from a urine infection and it turned out to be an appendicitis. My granddaughter fell off a trampoline and they x-rayed the wrong arm. Can they be any more dangerous in the role of care provider.,1
295790,Convenient: Quiet Saturday afternoon. Parked in nearby supermarket. Checked in and had to wait only 10 minutes. Excellence: Computer system had retained my records from previous hospital contact. Nurses worked well as a team. One took advice from another and formed a consensus on treatment I was comfortable with. The senior nurse performed some fairly delicate minor surgery that could have been painful but was done well. The treatment took only about 10 minutes and the team were all very professional and nice to deal with. Suggested improvements: (1) Top of my hate list with almost all brand new tax payer funded NHS facilities – stop putting laminated posters on the walls with blue tac and sticky tape. It ruins the décor. Notices are no longer noticeable when they cover the walls like confetti. Most of the inane signs are condescending to the clients and usually repeated unnecessarily repeated on multiple walls sometimes repeated on the same wall. Each use of a laminated poster facility should be approved individually by the CEO of the unit to prevent such shabby communication to the public. The waiting area had a large flat screen tv which could be used for messages. Placing a shabby poster on a wall asking clients if they have first reported to reception is poor. The official signs on display on entering the area should direct the public how to proceed. Asking the question as posed in the poster is the equivalent of saying to the clients “Are you stupid?”. (2) The minor injury clinic does not warrant a full time receptionist to book people in. The poor receptionist was bored out of their mind with the low volume of clients. It is a false economy to spare the clinicians this work (presumably because they cost more than a non clinical staff member). It would be more efficient and better use of resources to have a clinician to do check in and multitask with some clinical duties in between checking in clients. (3) Consider self check in. 90% of clients should be able to handle a computer questionnaire without assistance.,0
296134,i went into Labour on the Sunday early hours at 22 weeks and my waters breaking I rang up and the midwife on the phone was so rude and didn't believe a word I say and demanded I went in a ambulance after telling the midwife I would go in with a family member they put the phone down on me! I had to stay in until my son was born I was placed on a ward with pregnant mums babies crying in the end I was moved to my own side room with a tv to drown out the noise I woke up once with the tv off and remote gone the staff refused to give it me back and made me listen to babies cry for 9hours!

296248,"My partner suffered a hypoxic brain injury in Nov 2015 due to his heart stopping beating caused by arrthymia. After admittance to the lgi my partner was put into an induced coma from which he emerged a week later. He then had a defibrillator fitted at the lgi and was moved to chapel allerton hospital in December to recieve neurological rehabilitation for his brain injury. My partner had no mental awareness at this time, so was placed under a deprivation of liberty to protect himself from harm. Unfortunately my partner was found upstairs wandering the hospital corridors on his own, whilst in the care of the staff there. His stay was short lived as my partner is a diagonosed paranoid physophrenic, and unfortunately he suffered an episode of physcosis during his stay. What we cannot understand is why his anti physcotic medication olanzapine was not administered to my partner, why was it stopped and no alternative anti physcotic medication given and why his mental health was not treated along side his brain injury? As a result My partner ended up being removed from his rehabilitation and placed in newsham hospital where he was sectioned for a month. We have made a formal complaint and are still waiting for chapel allerton to reply 6 months down the line. It seems they are avoiding to answer our questions regarding my partners basic care needs. We also asked if olanzapine that my partner had been prescribed for over 20years for his mental health, if this medication had caused my partners arrhythmia? As someone stopped this medication and it had severe consequences for my partners mental health. my partner has lived in the community for the last 20years with a diagnosis of physophrenia, which he has successfully controlled with olanzapine and with no episodes of physcotic relapses. It has also resulted in my partner not recieveing his neurological rehabilitation for his hypoxic brain injury. Thus leaving my partner with severe short term memory loss and various disabilitating difficulties which he did not have post brain injury.",1

296716,"I have serious concerns about the Acre Mill overflow car parking arrangements and I hope these issues can be addressed when the car parking machine is replaced. 1.	There are inconsistencies in charging policy between this overflow site and the main site outside the hospital. In the latter there is a period of free car parking whilst in the former you have to pay a minimum £2.50. 2.	The signage within the car park. There are directions as to where to pay but they are not sufficiently prominent. On the one sign at the entrance to the car park the directions are placed near the base of a large board set to the left of a driver's line of sight as one drives in. The directions are written in a font smaller than the font of the rest of the notice. It is as though they are intended to be missed. If one does not see the directions on arrival and proceeds to park there appears to be no other notice facing the driver to indicate where to pay. There is no notice on the face of the building itself, for example. 3.	The location of the car parking ticketing machine. Why in the building? 4.	The location of the ticking machine within the building. The machine is sited directly opposite some east facing windows resulting in a significant amount of glare which can obstruct the visibility of the ticket machine's screen on a bright morning. 5.	The design of the machine. The characters on the keyboard of the ticketing machine are very small and set at some distance below the machine's screen making errors in typing a vehicle's registration number highly likely as one has to shift ones gaze from screen to keyboard over a long distance. 6.	Parking Terms and conditions. The fine imposed is a punitive £60. There is no notice warning the public that precision in keying in the registration number is absolutely essential if one is to avoid a fine. 7.	Furthermore there seems to be no corrective action that can be taken once the ticket is issued other than waiting for the Parking Charge Notice 28 days later and the risk rejection of the subsequent appeal.",0

297002,"Where to begin... My elderly father who has recently been diagnosed with luekemia and is also taking warfarin suffered a massive bleed from a wound in his foot, blood literally squirting like a hose accross the room and up the walls. My mum phoned an ambulance and then me. When I arrived a first response unit were there and had applied a pressure bandage. They were nice enough but when my crying mother who was in shock said she was scared my father was going to die the response was 'well we all have to die sometime'. Yeah thanks for that really helpful. Then the ambulance arrived two paramedics one proceeds to talk about themselves the whole time my father was loaded into the ambulance, I don't think they even asked his name, the other mute trainee was no help. Arrived at hospital where the nurse and ambulance staff are standing around talking over my dad who is laying on a stretcher below them, about menial crap whilst ignoring my dad. Doctor arrives spends 2 minutes with him the doctor can see by the look on my face I'm not impressed as I give the doctor key information which the doctor hasn't asked for like what drugs he's on etc. Then gets passed over to another nurse who was obviously very good at their job and managed to stop the bleeding, however the nurse didn't even look at my dads face just focused on the injury like they were a mechanic in kwik fit, so when I shouted at the nurse to stop because they hadn't noticed my dad was in absolute agony and required pain relief they were somewhat surprised. I am glad that I was there as I was the only friendly face who actually acknowledged my dad as a human being throughout the whole process. All of the staff who attended him that evening need to go on a course on how to treat the whole patient, not just the injury, if he had been on his own he would have been scared and in agony and not known what was going on. I am appalled and angry at how he was treated. I would give this hospital zero stars if possible it's absolutely awful.",0

So I chose to arrive at 06: 45 only to be told that there were no clinical staff on duty before 08: 00 and that x-ray did not start until 08: 30. So much for a 24 hour service! I was eventually seen over two hours after my arrival with no information or reason given for the delay which was later put down to 'traffic and computer delays'.

After I'd told the midwife I wasn't happy with babies heart beat (it had never been that high) and only being given paracetamol for my pain the midwife told me that the monitoring was still perfect and baby was happy.

I had to wait about 2 hours to see the senior nurse, who explained the treatment and options very clearly and got me on my way. Overall, very pleased with the service provided. Anything that can be done to reduce the time between x-ray and second assessment would really improve the unit. Would recommend getting there as early as you can.",0
298830,My husband was admitted to Blackpool vic on 15 th juse 2016 where they saw an anurism he was blue lighted to Preston hospital where they could not find an anurism. They done scans n bloods. Scan showed problem with his bowel. Blood test came back as gangrene in his system. They rushed him to theatre where they found 55% of his bowel had twisted and become gangrenous they removed it with part of his intestines. The level of care has been phenomenon. He is still a patient in here n could be home by the weekend. The staff have all been very helpful nothing is too much for them. I would highly recommend preston hospital,1
299019,"My mother has been a patient of the Anticoagulant Clinic for many years now. The nursing staff at the clinic have been providing an outstanding level of service since the very beginning. They provide a very high level of attention to care and have made the patient (my mother) feel very welcome and comfortable every time. Quality of care is also combined with the use of the latest technology, which has resulted in maximum patient comfort during INR testing with absolutely minimal waiting times. A very well done, and a personal thank you from me (and my mother) to you and your staff. Keep up the brilliant and professional work.",0
299205,"I went in by ambulance with a head injury after falling unconscious for 30 seconds, tingling sensations hot and cold flushes and extreme nausea. This was at 1130pm, when I reached a and e I was told there was a 3 hour wait, however I was not seen after waiting until 430am. After speaking with an elderly lady who fell forward with two black eyes and other facal injury I found she had been waiting for over 5 hours. Furthermore there was no one seen by a doctor from 3am until 430. Disgraceful waiting time.",1
299338,"My 92 year old mother had collapsed at home and was brought in by ambulance on in mid May. She was coherent, in a bed, the A&E doctor was excellent and treated my mother with respect and listened to her views, she also communicated well with me so I knew what was happening despite them being very busy. After four hours, probably, she was moved to the Acute Medical Ward, where the care and compassion in treating her was excellent. She was not an easy patient that evening, but they were very understanding of her and did all they could to help her feel cared for. We expected her to recover but the following morning she was unconscious, as requested in her will I told the nurse and doctor about her wish to not be resuscitated. This they respected and removed drips. My mother died later in the day, again this was handled so well by all involved. I particularly wish to thank the student nurse who was with my mother at the time she died, her care and compassion with my mother, myself and my father was amazing (especially for one so young) We arrived shortly after she died as my father was also ill and at the doctors prior to our visit, when we arrived they had given my mother her respect, combed her hair (which would have mattered to her) and were altogether lovely. I include the other staff on the ward, unfortunately I do not have any names as events moved so fast and I was also caring for my father. The doctor who saw my mother was also caring and also informative and helpful. What can I say, my mother had a peaceful death, she was not pulled around, she had respect, she was with her husband a few hours before, she was in hospital only 24 hours from entering A&E. It was a 'good death' She was spared living a half-life in care, this, as a strong, independent lady, she would have hated. If I can be as fortunate in my going, I will be grateful. thank you to all at East Surrey Hospital who made this difficult experience a good one.",0
299717,"My daughter was admitted via A/E recently .She arrived in the afternoon and was not seen for almost 9 hours by doctors they decided to admit her, a bed was not found till 3 hours after that. My daughter is unfortunately an IV drug user, now on a programme of methadone. ..her Left arm became very inflamed so she went to A/E, after a long wait the doctors decided she should be admitted with considering surgery for an oncoming abcess...She was given an IV of antibiotics, and kept in a single room, and totally ignored..Eventually I managed to talk to the ward sister who calmed her down..She was on IV for a few days and becos her obs were satisfactory she was discharged. She came to me this week with a very swollen red arm. My GP saw her arm in surgery o and referred her straight to the hopsital we spent 4 hrs in A/E, blood was taken, a line put in incase any drugs were needed.. Doctor saw my daughter and she was referred to the Surgical Assessment ward where she was admitted and surgery was performed to lance and pack the wound She was discharged to me... They would not provide transport for her, even though she was groggy from the anaestheitc, oromorph for pain and methadone... I had to pay for a taxi. My beef with medway is, had she been properly looked after and not discharged the first time, her surgery would not have been an emergency ... They discharged her in severe pain.... with a bad infected arm...had my daughter left going to the hospital in Ipswich for surgery another week, she would have maybe lost her arm or died of septacaemia. drug users, alcoholics, anorexics are all human beings..when I worked in healthcare I NEVER discriminated anyone, black, white, rich, poor, fat, slim, Jew, muslim, everyone was the same to me..I think todays NHS needs a good shake up....I think staff attitude to drug users needs to be improved.",1
299800,"I arrived at the blood test reception at 5.38pm for a walk-in appointment. Initially I was told that none was available until 6.05pm but that appointments were running late and I could expect a wait of a further 20 minutes after the appointment time. I decided to accept the appointment and wait - it then transpired that there was a 5,50pm appointment available and in fact I was seen at 5.51pm in cubicle 5! Service was quick, polite and efficient. I was back at the car park at 5.56pm and as the whole visit had taken less than 30 minutes the car parking was free - fantastic! So much better than the waiting around at St Andrew's for walk-in tests which are often not available. (As I am never sure when I will finish work I am unable to book an appointment in advance.) My only criticism is that reception staff were, apologetically, unable to tell me how the car parking system worked - I was expecting to have to wait and therefore pay the £3.00 minimum parking fee and did not have change and no-one know whether for a stay of under 30 minutes whether I still had to queue to register that stay with the pay machine - more information clearly on display in the car park would be advantageous. Thank you for excellent service in the blood test department.",0
299764,"When I first took my baby boy home from queens hospital he was discharged with a rattley chest in September '15. When he was around 11 weeks old he came over very listless one day, he wouldn't drink and I could hear him wheezing over the TV. I took him to a walk in polyclinic where he was diagnosed with bronchitis and we were sent home with an asthma inhaler. Later that night we rushed him into queens hospital where he was taken through to resus, there were around 7/8 doctors and nurses, some standing around googling or on the phone and others running around like headless chickens, which was terrifying for a new mum, I was in hysterics. He was discharged 4 days later, better but still with a rattley chest.. He was admitted back 4 days later, at that time there were no beds left at Queens so we were taken to The Royal London Hospital where he was surveyed closely and thankfully got better and we never needed to return back. Until, beginning of June '16 I came down with a viral infection and inevitably my son caught it too, he was having difficulty breathing so again I rushed him to queens, the wait for a baby fighting for breath was appalling, we were seen after around half an hour and was told 'he just has a viral infection, it will clear up in 7-10 days'. I could not destress enough about it being bronchitis again, I asked numerous times that they were certain it wasn't and they were 'certain'. Now if I had listened and waiting 7-10 days my son would have been very ill indeed, 3 days later i took him back in this was unacceptable. We were seen a lot quicker as I think they knew. Once again they had no beds and after a 6 hour wait we were transferred into King George's hospital where the care, time and patience really shone, the relief I felt for my sons life was incredible compared to at queens knowing their previous mistakes with the same thing. I'm not entirely blaming staff but they're so understaffed it's a joke and you can clearly see the strain.",1

There were communication problems initially getting regular treatment but once those were overcome the treatment was done with professionalism, care and friendliness. They also referred her to the 'therapy' unit (Mum's memory of who they were) and she was visited by Jessica, Assistant Practitioner. Jessica assessed Mum's physical needs and ensured that she had whatever aids could help her. she also started Mum on some physio which initially caused some discomfort to her injured leg but once the wound was healed they got along well and Mum was very pleased with her visits and is still regularly doing her exercises and thinks that they are helping her mobility.",0

Its simple if you do the maths waiting time up to 5 hours. I had a similar experience in the Ophthalmology O. P. Dept. Waiting room full at 8. 30 not seen until 11. 30.

Thankfully another nurse grabbed a sick bowl for me just in time, the nurse was also very unhelpfully to another lady who had an accident leaving her to sit on wet sheets.

I received reminder letters well in advance, texts and phone calls approaching the appointment. The hospital is modern, clean and well-appointed. My appointment consisted of three test including a consultancy. All were on time, the process was well managed and seamless and I was out within half an hour of the appointed time. This is a fine example of how the NHS should be. Also, getting there is a doddle - there are frequent bus services from much of north and west London, to a bus station immediately outside the main entrance.

Since our initial registration the Practice has moved with the times, telephone conversations with Docters, booking appointments online and same day appointments if necessary.

Nursing care from the team was first class. The professionalism, skill and efficiency of the Consultant Surgeon was absolutely excellent in every way, inspiring total confidence.

My only comment is to ask for specific instructions if you need gas & air, as when you use it properly it works a treat & made things much more bearable. Not a procedure I would rush to have again but I would definitely recommend the Endoscopy Unit at the Cumberland Infirmary for it",0
302563,"After a delayed diagnosis of bowel cancer (told symptoms were constipation) he underwent oral chemo and radiotherapy which made the tumour disappear. He was then told he needed to undergo surgical removal of shrunken tumour. We saw there was a trial called 'Wait & Watch' and he fitted the criteria, the surgeon said he would refer him. The senior colorectal nurse told him if he waited to be accepted onto trial or changed his mind he would face a wait for surgery (scary). My husband told them he would rather die than end up with a permanent colostomy to which the surgeon reassured him that he could operate using keyhole surgery and gave him a 98% chance of not being left with a colostomy. My husband asked the surgeon if he'd read his case notes, the surgeon said no then reduced the chance to 92%. My husband on the morning of his surgery told the surgeon that rather than ending up with a colostomy he would prefer the surgeon to cut him open to do the op because he'd said it might be tricky to reattach his bowel due to the keyhole and the size of the staple gun he'd be using. If the surgeon had had any doubt my husband would not have undergone the planned technique, the surgeon again reassured him. He woke up with a permanent colostomy. The trial for those with the courage to go on it is doing very well. The surgeon gave him a permanent stoma which began to spiral out of his body so that his bowel protruded from his stomach by 12 inches, it was eventually repaired by a different surgeon but he has recurring sepsis and has been on many courses of antibiotics. He has to have a prescription for antibiotics ready for when it happens. It has hospitalised him 3 times.",1

However, we have noticed that there is still no pavement connecting the bike parking area, even though a short connecting section to the new car park would be only a few feet long. To make matters worse, there is now a chain link fence on the grass opposite the motorbike parking. We can understand this if it is to stop parking on the grass, but it makes pedestrian access from the motorcycle parking area more difficult and more dangerous now.

The night staff seem as though they don't want to be there. I have learned that there is no management on site during the night because of cost. Since this is a 365 day 24 hours a day business, it seems ridiculous that the people who are responsible for the care, motivation and the culture of the hospital ie the management should be only on site for half the working day. It doesn't have to cost more to change the management contract to facilitate 24 hour management. The staff will appreciate this. It would be a positive indication of a single team being led at all times from the front, and have a positive effect on the business.

306112,"In October 2015 my mother was taken into A+E at Aintree University Hospital. She had become diabetic and had low potassium. When being moved on and off a portable toilet a chunk of skin was torn from her bottom. When moved onto a ward they thought this was a bed sore. (and photographed it ) The ward mislaid her notes, she was given potassium in levels that caused her to blow up like a balloon and her leg to split. One night a nurse gave mum the wrong medication. Three patients from her room told me that a patient had refused laxatives and they witnessed the nurse giving them to my mother. My mother, who had a previous bad reaction to them, told me she had been sleeping and did not realise what she had been given until it was too late. My sister visited early morning - Our Mother was sat in diarrhoea and had used a box of tissues to put between her and it I visited early evening - again she was sat in diarrhoea with an open cut on her bottom. She now had a urinary tract infection. I obviously complained to doctors and management who said they would investigate. What actually happened was the nurse concerned was questioned ( but not the witnesses ) I was told that laxatives did not appear on my mothers medical records and that this confirmed the nurses statement that she did not give them to my mother. Then THE WORST My mother (aged 83 with part of her lung previously removed) told me that in the middle of the night, when she was sleeping, she was physically intimidated and threatened by a nurse in order that she would not say anything. Two patients woke up whilst this was happening and witnessed my mum asking her to stop very frightened. One patient told me she was so upset by what she witnessed it made her cry. A third patient (C) told me she woke up to hear the nurse snap at patient who was crying. Afterwards patient (C) stood by mums bed and held her hand to try and comfort her. The crying patient answered the nurse and told her that she was crying because my mother was a lovely person, that she (the nurse) was clearly distressing her. She did not get a reply from the nurse. This Patient told me the nurse came back when Mum's bed needed to be changed. The nurse said she would come back with the other nurse but it was left so long that they got out of bed to go and remind them (she found them sat at the desk chatting) All three patients told me it was the same nurse that had given my mother laxatives. A member of the senior management team told me she would take patient statements and gave me her word that she would make sure this nurse would not be allowed onto the same ward as my mother again. I stopped overnight with my mother who became agitated when medication was being issued. I asked the nurse issuing the medications for her name It was the same nurse. The nurse was not suspended for an investigation and as far as I am aware she still works in the same hospital. My Mother died. Sepsis (ongoing septicaemia/blood poisoning) was listed on her death certificate. Septicaemia is down to poor hygiene and nursing procedures (It only takes one nurse to undo the good of others) Before her death I had asked why my mother was being given blood and was told by the person giving it that it is just to give her some extra help fighting the infection. I asked what infection the consultant had said her results were clear. They became reluctant to talk and went away quickly. I asked the consultant they told me she did not have an infection that they don't give blood for this reason. I asked what was the reason and they said just to give her a boost. We had not been told she had septicaemia. The week of her death both her doctor and consultant told us she would be coming home after some intensive physio. Two days before she died we had to argue to get antibiotics for her when she was clammy and becoming confused. ( Mentally she was normally sharp as a pin. ) The doctor gave them to her saying he was only giving them as a precaution as he didn't want anything to hold her up from being moved onto the intensive physio ward. I have sent written complaints to the Hospital and received, in my opinion, written denials for six months. I now have copies of my Mothers medical records: - There is a computer print out which we think proves laxatives were given. Records for the relevant dates are missing. Photograph of injury (caused by A+E) is missing As far I understand, the hospital took one patient statement only (10 days after the event). ",1

I complained 4 times and was told they had lost her notes even though they hadn't seen her so still left to sit to listen to the 5 receptionists around the desk talking about their holidays and how much fat was in a chocolate bar they were eating. When they eventually got to mum she was admitted, no information given to me reference what checks they were doing and what was the reason for this 81 year old lady had fallen who also had dementia. totally messed about when it came to picking her up and than when I found her she was not dressed and wearing no underwear which was brought in by me and she had asked for a ladies pad but they said they had none so was left sitting with no underwear on in her nighty not been washed or hair brushed and stinking of urine. Discharge letter gave no clue as to what had happened shocking treatment of my mum and they kept feeding her omelette and mum cant eat eggs due to migraine so mum thank god didn't eat but snacked on the things I had brought in for her .

Majors worked hard under constant pressure from the steady flow of casualties, emergencies and constant stream of people all needing help and attention. The tea bar and tea trolley was extremely welcome and the staff were friendly and helpful. Well done the volunteers.... ******",0
307188,"My father in his last weeks begged us to get him home, we thought he was just being grumpy and difficult. He passed away at home. The following day my mother found herself in ward 9 and whilst the Doctors, consultants and most nurses were excellent, the staff nurse on night duty was appalling. Swearing, cursing for everyone to hear. One poor lady was buzzing.. and the nurse swore and refused to go.. we were told that the following day this poor lady had passed away alone. No dignity or respect for the elderly.. which now makes me question my fathers concerns.. maybe he wasn't grumpy at all.. I think he was scared and frightened. Its a shame that just one person can pull a whole place down.",0
307259,"Tried to find ophthalmology dept today. The appointment letter failed to provide a map or accurate address. The switchboard put me through to reception which at 12:20 went to answerphone; the sitemap on the website is still out of date. In the end reading reviews led me to try outpatients on the other side of the road. Last week I had to go to Calderdale - what a contrast; a clear an accurate sitemap and clear signage. You responded to a critical posting a YEAR ago yet in reality you have done nothing. Signage is still very poor, Perhaps you should deliver more services at Calderdale.....",0
307440,"My 85 year old father was admitted in March after collapsing at home. He had an extremely long wait outside A&E in an ambulance but once he was actually admitted he had excellent care. He ended up spending a month on the Short Stay Surgery ward due to that being the only bed for him, and despite him being very challenging at times (with dementia and a psychotic-type episode during his stay), the staff were extremely kind and caring and genuinely seemed quite fond of him by the time he was discharged to a care home.",0
307359,"My mum has recently been transferred to this ward from Clatterbridge after treatment for cancer. When it was realised shed had an infection, she was placed on ward 20. My brother & I were told the Dr wanted to speak to us. He thought she was there for palliative care & wanted to know about resus (y/n)! . Then I was told she had hospital borne pneumonia, my brother was told it is a bowel infection. We (and she) thought her diarrhoea was caused by the liquid food, turns out she was being given laxatives by mistake. I am asking if she will make it out alive?",1
307792,New hip on 7th June: for the first time for 3+ years pain-free walking. Informative and well organised out-patient visits x 3. Very well organised and almost enjoyable immediate pre-anaesthetic management. Comfy in Recovery. Kindly looked after in Bramshott Ward - staff generoous with pain relief. Home in 4 days. Fully mobile in 3 weeks. All matters went well in this routine and very well delivered surgical service. I have ample confidence in all staff members who delivered a very high level product. I would be content to receive any other orthopaedic proceedure from the surgeon and staff. Very many thanks.,0
307747,"After being admitted urgently the lack of care, communication and compassion was dreadful. After waking up from what was to be keyhole surgery to realising has had more done, not knowing if I had had a hysterectomy or why I had been opened up!, Left 10 plus hours not being told what had happened except by an over imposing nurse who really didn't know. No pain relief as no plan in place for my medical requirement. Had to literally beg and scream for some kind of pain relief totally inhuman and unacceptable. Having many allergies the pain management nurse was abrupt, dismissive and rude left me in unacceptable pain. A very traumatic experience.",1
307887,"My daughter was admitted to AMU for having unexplained seizures. My daughter already has Asperger syndrome so has a degree of mental health issues, in the fact that she is mentally and emotionally not her age. She has been feeling low and depressed lately for a number of personal issues such as bereavement and had already been admitted to the hospital at the end of may as her friend had rung her an ambulance stating that she was having a seizure. The hospital discharged her after one night for intoxication even though she had barely had anything to drink. 3 weeks ago she had another seizure and her GP referred her to see the neurologist. Then last week she had a large seizure whilst at work and ended up back in the hospital. They decided to admit her this time due to the severity of the seizure and the fact she was continuing to have them whilst still in hospital. She was admitted to AMU and it was four days before she had a CT and the MRI and I feel that we had to argue and make a real fuss for that as they seemed in no hurry to do it. All the time she continued to have violent seizures, several a day and her mental health was being severely affected. As the tests came back clear it was decided that the likelihood was that she was having seizures as a result of her depression and mental health state. I would say that a third of the staff were very good and understanding with my daughter and took time to reassure her as she was very frightened, she did not understand why this was happening to her. The rest of the staff were awful, as they treated her like a naughty child that was doing it on purpose even though the doctors made it very clear that she had no control over the seizures. I had asked staff to ensure that I was rung should she have a seizure and I was not there or if she was frightened at all, it was only really at nighttime that I did not stay. I had a phone call one night to say that she had had a seizure but strongly implied that she had done it to herself as she lowered herself safely to the floor, but I was not to worry as she was safe and sleeping now in bed. When I arrived the next morning 3 other patients which were also in the bay told me that they were surprised that I had not been in the night before, as she had a seizure and was very very distressed. I told the three patients what I had been told the previous night and this had actually been documented in her notes that she had safely lowered herself to the floor, all three patients said what a load of rubbish she hit the floor with force, which staff did not witness and was left fitting on the floor for several minutes before any staff came into the room. The following night I stayed a lot later as she was very distressed from the night before, she had two large fits, and staff just pulled the curtain around her and left us to it. When the nurse did eventually come back into her bed area twenty minutes later, and she was still fitting which was very frightening and distressing for us, I asked her that if she pulled the curtains round her did it mean that she could not see her therefore she did not need to worry? to which she replied that it is upsetting the other patients, like she was some naughty child acting up. I spoke with a staff member on the Wednesday night asking her to just sit with her for 5 minutes if she fitted til I got there as I was only down the road, she flatly refused, stating that she had thirty patients to look after and could not just sit with one distressed patient. Again, we were made to feel like she was a naughty child acting up, so then I felt I could not leave her. I did eventually leave in the early hours once I was satisfied that she was settled and not likely to wake up. When I returned the next morning, my daughters curtains were again pulled around her bed. When I went behind the curtains she was all alone on her bed fitting, lying on her back, I was very concerned for her safety as she had vomited with some of the previous seizures and they could now not see her and had left her alone. The whole experience was very traumatic and we was made to feel like she was faking it as it was a mental health issue. She is home now but still fitting, not as often and not as severe as she feels safer.",1
308174,"I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She suffered a fall in Spain whilst on holiday. She was attended to immediately by doctors there and was told to go and see a doctor/specialist in London as soon as she arrived. When my mother came back home she went to A&E. After waiting several hours in the A&E department, the doctor who saw her told was dismissive towards her and told her she would need another appointment but would have to wait another week. When she told the doctor that was too long and that she was in agony, the doctor replied that she was lucky not to wait any longer. My mother has to climb 42 steps to go back home, and she suffers from osteoarthritis. She rarely complains only when necessary. I was also very upset that my mother had been treated this way.",0
308165,"I have recently visited the RBH for three consecutive appointments. Pleased that they were made close together. The evening appointment, my first, was very good as it enabled us to park more easily! We met extremely friendly, helpful people who directed us to the right place. Very good care from the staff - CT scan. The following morning's appointment - cystoscopy, I have to admit, I dreaded. I shouldn't have. I was treated with utmost respect and apart from an anxious wait for over an hour, it was a 'walk in the park'. The magazines were aimed at men - need more variety! My final visit to the medical physics department was the better of the three. What a lovely team of professionals. I cannot see a mark from where the nurse had to insert a needle! Another member of staff with such and interesting conversation about Sweden, put me totally at ease. However, this department need current reading material, not dating back to Christmas and before! I should like to help them re this project. My only complaint would be re the written appointments. Really proof read before printing and sending. It only takes seconds as the letters are on a template and saves several 'phone calls and frustration from the patient. I received a 7pm. one written 07:00 hours pm. (are we digital or analogue?) and what should have been an August appointment sent at the end of July for the beginning of July! However, that apart, I have no complaints re the important bit - the procedures. I have zero pain threshold! I survived with a smile due to the kindness and understanding from all staff concerned. Thank you so much! Just the results I'm eagerly waiting for, then can hopefully 'move forward' !",0

When I phoned outpatient appointments phone rung and went through the numbering for 15 mins! Tried at other times, no one answered the phone. Emailed the appointments email, no confirmation this arrived and no response. Pals unable to help. No wonder appointment times are months in advance, no one can get through!

308692,My wife fell on rocks adjoining Burgh Island. As she could walk we were referred to the drop in centre. She had sustained a nasty cut on the bridge of her nose and after registering she was treated promptly by the nurse. I had fallen a couple of days previously and hurt my hand so asked if they could take a look whilst I was there. I was xrayed almost straight away and it was discovered I had broken a metacarpel bone which was strapped and given advice on treatment when at home as we were enroute. Admittedly they were relatively quiet but we were both dealt with inside 1.5 hrs. Amazing service!,0
308542,"We had to come from Cannock. First of all, its disgusting paying for a disabled space then having to drive around for 20 mins before a space became available after dropping mom off at entrance. Then we had to wait over an hour and ten mins for our ticket to be called. The receptionist had to let us know of delay as phlebotomy staff didnt. They were so slow and two on compared to Cannock (same morning - 3 staff and no parking charge!). The cost of parking was £2.80!!!! Why cant more staff be available for busier periods!!!!! Why cant there be a TV LIke x-ray / pharmacy / endoscopy to while away a boring amount of time! And to finish off- why doesnt outpatients appear in drop down menu for 'which department'?",0

309647,"My husband was admitted for emergency surgery here and the entire experience was utterly shocking and upsetting (just like the last time we were here). The ward sisters were unhelpful, rude and made my husband walk out to the corridor despite being in excruciating pain rather than let me visit him in the ward briefly before being taken to surgery. Upon discharge a junior doctor gave an entirely wrong account of what procedure was actually performed (thankfully we bumped into the surgeon on our way out who told us what had really been done) and no information regarding aftercare, recovery etc. The next day the ward was under obligation to organise a nurse to visit my husband for aftercare but despite several calls and enquiries on our side no one came and rather than with an apology we were left with rude, indifferent, unsympathetic and unhelpful nurses who refused to give us any contact or way of making sure his wound would be attended to.

The hospital didn't do anything to prevent this from happening, and even when she was found, didn't care about her state... She is an emigrant and as she's not well she refused to return to her country with her family. Right now she's alone in her rented room whit no family or friends in UK.

He got to his doctors who then rang for an ambulance to take him to whiston hospital. A few hours later although still dragging his left leg and unable to use his left arm and hand he was discharged. As he lives on his own I was mortified. He didnt have a good weekend. He phoned his doctor three days later to ask how long it would be before he would be able to walk and use his arm and hand properly. The doctor couldnt believe he had been discharged. Its too late to rectify his treament but hopefully it doesnt happen to anyone else. To be fair the nurse who attended him was very concerned. She asked three different times was the doctor sure he could be discharged and was told he was fine now.,1

I am impressed with the speed of the turnaround, very efficient. It was my first visit, the location is part of a shopping mall, pleasantly quiet with easy parking and all mod cons imaginable such as pharmacy and eating places.

Apparemtly if you leave a burn uncovered the pain is worse when air gets to it.No wonder he screamed everytme she removed her hands from the water.

I queried that she had not been given any pills around teatime it was noted that they had in fact not given any antibiotic to my mum who is elderly. She was unsteady on her feet due to infection but despite asking nurse on 5 separate occasions (the same nurse) my mum was not given antibiotic until the evening - 11 hours after admission.

Surely you keep records of who is wandering ward with dementia patients locked in on the 5th floor? Your claims that you cant find who needs retraining are ludicrous. My mum can say what happened to her, the other patients can't. What kind of vulnerable patient protection do you have? Why does my mums competence in recalling the event weeks later have any weight? Victim bullying comes to mind. Sherwood hospital Mansfield Kingsmill if you don't admit responsibility what will stop it happening again.

315543,"My gran who lives alone had a fall in her home. She managed to call her daughter to advise her of her fall - my aunt quickly went to see her. My gran suffers from short term memory problems so was unclear where she had fallen but could not stand upright. We called for an ambulance as she was in alot of pain - we were told that it was not an emergency and they would get to her as soon as they could. 4 hours later the ambulance arrived - they suspected she had broken her hip and took her to the QE at Gateshead. This was after 9pm and remember she is 90 years old - they then had to go through triage which took over 3 hours from her being received into A&E to being seen by a doctor - she was put in an assessment room where the doctor said nothing was broken. After some time convincing him something was wrong and pushing for an X-ray they relunctantly obliged. The X-ray they said showed as they suspected nothing was damaged broken or fractured it was just muscle damage. Well 3 weeks later and my gran was re-admitted this time we suspected she may have had a mini-stroke but we werent sure. We called 101 around 4pm and were told a doctor would call back - after 3 further calls we were advised paramedics would be sent. Thankfully my gran had recovered from whatever had happened to her earlier - at 11pm the paramedics arrived, believing she may have had a mini-stroke took her to the QE. The paramedics were from St John Ambulance and they were unhappy with the length of time this 90 year old lady had to wait. She is now in the QE hospital, she has had another XRay as the previous X-ray was not clear - it has now been established that she had fractured her pubic bone! Not great from the first visit and that my gran has suffered the pain without any pain relief for over 3 weeks.

The thought of visiting the clinic used to fill me with dread wondering how long I would have to wait. Its a take a ticket and wait for your number system. Previously it would take on average 3 or more minutes for the number to tick to the next person and I would often have to run back to the car park to extend my parking time. The are still queues of around 20 - 30 people when it first opens but the average time for the number to tick seems to have come down a lot and now takes maybe a minute and a half. Still room for improvement but heading in the right direction at least.,0
315922,"I am horrified that staff have been unable to reassure my daughter who is looking after a friend who has been admitted following an overdose. I tried to share information the patient had given to show that they were quite fixated on suicide but was discouraged from doing so. My daughter phoned me as she was so concerned about leaving her friend in this hospital and, having spoken to an individual there, I can understand why. I'm in N Ireland and only called the hospital on the advice of one of our Suicide Prevention organisations who were extremely concerned at the apparent lack of care and compassion for the patient and concerned friends. Very disappointing and cause for concern. I'm a teacher so I've advised my daughter to leave now, as the hospital are now responsible for her friend.",0
316227,"I visit this centre regularly for a wide range of services and am always happy with the service I receive. Staff are friendly and polite and do their best to accommodate all guests and ensure they receive the right information. I am unsure why the reviews below are bad, there are baby changing facilities located in the main building and in terms of the long wait... the walk in service for baby weigh in is for exactly that, for the baby's weight to be checked. All other health visitor services are by appointment only which all guests are told....",0
316572,"My sister went to A&E today with suspected appendicitis. The triage part went quite smoothly, but when she was brought in for further assessment we were not impressed. The first person she saw, one hour after being brought in (and four hours after our arrival in A&E) was an anaesthetist, who started talking about operations when we hadn't even been told what was wrong or what was happening. It was another three hours before she was finally discharged with an ""unspecified"" viral infection. It's appalling that NMUH is willing to let its patients go seven hours without being told what's happening to them, especially with a potentially very serious illness that may require surgery.",0
316729,"I recently attended the week Pain Management course. The course is intended to help you cope & manage your pain on a daily basis. It gives you the tools to get the best out of each & every day. It obviously doesn't get rid of it but allows you to be surrounded by people who have pain & understand your issues. You can be involved in group conversations as much as you want or be quiet & take it all in. I felt that the more you put in the more you take away. Whilst every tool shown/discussed isn't for everyone & truly believed in giving everything a go. It has certainly helped me reduce the amount of pain medication I take. All of the team including Gemma (psychologist), Eva (physio) & Sue (pain nurse) are friendly, approachable & non judgemental. I highly recommend this course to anyone in pain.",0
317280,"My daughter was admitted to ward 12 after breaking her finger she stayed before and after surgery , her first operation was cancelled not one nurse or doctor told her that she could have a drink because the op was cancelled or most important given any pain relief we came to the hospital for 9am this was after 4pm disgusting non caring staff walking around texting talking to each other in the corridor twice I went to the desk to ask for pain relief for my daughter and the six nurses and doctors stood around talking ignoring me , when I did get their attention they just looked like I was an alien , even worse so called care , poor old lady buzzed for bed pan and 20mins later after she had had an accident in bed the nurse decided to come with the bed pan and then complain saying 'well you've already done it ' no respect was shown no sympathy no care , another accident again from the lady some time after no fault of hers but was made to feel it was.

317690,"I attended my appointment at the Musculo-skeletal service within the Physiotherapy Outpatients for an assessment today and was delighted with the quality of service I received. I was given a thorough examination for my symptoms followed by a clear and comprehensive explanation of my condition along with the options of treatment available to me. I was given plenty of time to be able to ask questions before deciding on the most suitable course of action.. The Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioner who assessed me was very professional, considerate and helpful. I now feel quite content moving forward.",0

She was given a chest X-ray which was not reported and treated as nil acute. She was put on broad spectrum anti biotics late on day 1 for chest crackles.

Notes were removed from her bed and one observation written on toilet tissue. There is going to be a coroners inquest but we are distraught and perplexed.",1

I had no explanation as to how he did it so they called social services. Two days later my son was upset about pain in his other leg and he had a rash come up so i took him back and they sent us home, the next day he was so upset, he wouldnt let me or anyone touch him. The rash was getting worse, so i took him back again. it turned out his leg was not broken but he has henoch schonlein purpura.He had been seen by so many different doctors over the weekend and it caused me and him so much stress and they didnt call social services to say they made a mistake so ive had to deal with that too.

319166,Recently me nanna in Newcastle had a fall. She was on the floor alone for hours before family found her. She broke her finger and wrist and she had a bleed between her brain tissue and her skull. She was left very fragile and unsteady on her feet. She stayed at Rake Lane hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne. My family and I all think she has been discharged far too early. She is not medically fit to be back in the community. If it was the staff members family they would not expect them to go home so soon.,0

I'm visiting each day and using the multi story carpark. tried several times to purchase a Weekly Parking voucher with both debit and credit cards....But, the auto machines reject every card, I wonder why, is this a money spinning venture ? Also, there is zero facilities of parking of cycle or motorcycles. using the main carparks require you to dismount to access the entrance / exit barriers which is both blocking for other users and dangerous with slippery surfaces to motorcycles. ! .

However, the staff can't be praised highly enough.The member of staff in a&e reception was polite and efficient, a standard repeated throughout my visit. The staff are exceptionally good at all aspects of their jobs leaving my customer care expectations fully satisfied. When I was admitted, the superb standards continued. I had an individual room with en-suite facilities. Top grade management was reflected in standards from top to bottom. Cleanliness is a top priority. I would be very proud of all the staff.

The assessment made by the AP was comprehensive and reassured me that I was being seen by somebody who was professional, informative and an expert in their own field. All possible treatment options were discussed with me and I am very happy with the service that I received. In addition to the assessment itself the receptionist was warm and welcoming and set an excellent atmosphere for the department itself. My next appointment was made collaboratively to suit my busy schedule. I would recommend this service to anybody.",0
320263,"My aunt was admitted to the mri through a&e and it took them a whole week just to get her to the right department. She was told she had cancer with no explanation, no conversation, nothing by a Consultant, who when questioned about this called it 'a blip'. Wow. Talk about conceited. She was left in severe pain for two weeks drugged up on morphine with no investigation. Sadly she picked up a hospital superbug whilst there and was admitted to the ICU. she deteriorated here and passed away a few weeks later. Some of the ICU staff were lovely. However overall i was appalled by the rudeness, lack of concern, flippancy and overall uncaring attitude of many of the staff members. When my aunt was dying one of the nurses was so rough around her almost treating her like she wasn't a person. Another nurse was very rude to me whilst all my family members stood around my dying aunts bed crying they were complaining that we had put something on a sterile trolley. I mean, seriously, my aunt was dying right there we had been told she had about an hour to live, we were all crying and this nurse was complaining about a sterile trolley. I really don't think when a beloved member of your family is dying unexpectedly and suddenly that anyone would be thinking oh i should or shouldn't put my bag here or there, and how were we to know the trolley was sterile? Disgusting and absolutely disrespectful and nasty. I feel sick when I think about it. I would not recommend this hospital. I am terrified of the thought of anyone being here. I don't care if you are understaffed and overworked they are human beings you're treating not pieces of meat. Wake up you NHS robots.",1

The doctor slammed down my bed after they looked at my ex rays and the pain was incredible. They looked shocked at my reaction because they said I was OK after reviewing my ex rays. The excellent paramedic in the ambulance said that I would be cat scanned as well as exrayed but this didn't happen and I therefore left hospital that night.When the morphine wore off in the middle of the night and I called the NHS about the massive pain I was in, they asked me to attend hospital.

321399,"My 81yr old mother arrived via ambulance with severe stomach pains. After hours of waiting she was eventually seen butt communication terrible. Two registrars did communicate well and eventually diagnosed serious liver infection. Mum had been sat on a chair 12grs before a bed was allocated even though we were told staying in after 5hrs! I think it would have been an even longer wait had I not pushed and complained telling staff the situation was not acceptable! Mum was found a bed within 30mins of me being quite candid and direct. I was told by one staff that someone had been waiting over 24hrs! I had to toilet my mum on own and put her to bed. She has Alzhiemers and was very confused by the time she was in the ward. She is now in Ward H3 and I leave her feeling worried about her care. Yesterday her drip wasn't in correctly and all her top vest and underwear, bending was full of blood. Thank goodness we noticed as I'm not confident staff would have. Ward wasn't staff enough with lower grade nurses/auxiliary. I'm very worried now that my mum who was strong and very perky even in A&E will deteriorate not due to illness but lack of care from hospital staff. I worry about people who don't have family to raise concerns.",1
321621,This website is not easy to use. 1 I cannot use the return key on my iPad to input to this box. 2 The Department index only lists C to V so I can not find X-ray which is where my wife is visiting today (24th October 2016 at 0850 ). 3 The map does not include details of the Hospital buildings so I can not find the X-ray building or Car park. 4 I discovered another website secretly buried within the first which showed a complete Department index and a complete map of Hospital site ! 5 My overall opinion of the website is that it is dominated by NHS General info as opposed to useful individual hospital info. 6 Please bear in mind that I did a search for Hemel Hempstead Hospital not NHS !,0

'They won't be in if taken less than a week ago', Consultant asked for me to come in when the results are in. 'If consultant asked you to come in then come in'. Finally operator goes and checks, 'results are not in, try again in a few days'. How many appointments wasted by results not being back? simple admin functions just not working. Terrible.",0
322089,"My father who was elderly and dying of cancer was admitted to ward 24 supposedly to leave the following day. He ended up stuck there for 8 days for the most part being ignored by the nurses, as were several other elderly patients on the ward. They were sharing their rooms with several ""junkies"" suffering from withdrawal symptoms or going through detox who often got violent demanding constant supervision from nurses to the point where other patients were constantly overlooked. The violence and/or intimidating behavior clearly frightened the elderly and deprived them of much needed rest. One night many patients had to be locked in a room for their own safety whilst one of these addicts raged and was eventually pinned to the floor and restrained by security. My father and another elderly gentleman, both on special diets were given the wrong food for days until we complained, and was not allowed out of their beds to stretch their legs or go to the toilet instead encouraged to use bedpans and urinals. My father who was relatively happy and active prior to his admission suffered a rapid deterioration of his condition such that he could barely walk, was severely dehydrated, had lost a considerable amount of weight, and was intensely depressed by the time we eventually got him out 8 days later. His discharge was delayed due to oversight with discharge paperwork we were eventually told, and it turned out that 2 other elderly gentleman in his room had discharge delays due to similar errors causing them considerable anxiety too. Why are drug addicts even placed with these gentlemen? Why should addicts be given more care such that other patients suffer? Why are there (apparently) no specialist facilities and nurses at DRI for addicts so that they are not mixed with other patients threatening violence, intimidating and being aggressive around vulnerable elderly patients requiring delicate care, rest and recuperation? DRI used to be so much better but after this experience, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.",1

322523,I took my father to be admitted to ward 112 yesterday for knee surgery he is in his seventys and a diabetic with high blood pressure which is being controlled with medication .he was told pre admission not to take any medication or food prior to his operation .upon booking in he was ushered to a waiting room and told relatives were to go home I ignored the request for me to go home and waited with him . After three hours of him sitting in a chair I noticed him becoming unwell I went to the reception desk to inform them he was diabetic they said oh is he after forty five minutes someone eventually came to him .after another hour they took him to the ward this is now four hours since admission. On arrival on the ward they prepared him for surgery it was at this point five hours after admission they informed him his blood pressure was high and gave him his blood pressure medication and told us he would have to wait another hour for his pressure to come down .they then retested his blood pressure and it had significantly improved after another half hour a sister came in to inform him his surgery had been cancelled due to the fact theatre didn't want to take the risk of giving him epidural with high blood pressure and they had already changed there list and couldn't wait around forever for it to comedown .this is disgraceful and I wonder what would have happened if I had gone home .my dad was extremely upset and will refuse to have the surgery he so desperately needs to keep patients especially orthopaedic patients sitting in chairs five six hours is disgraceful.I myself had taken four days off work to be there for him he had gone twenty hours without food or medication had gone through extreme anxiety and was told upon leaving to take his tablets next time if I had not been there he would have been stuck at the hospital feeling unwell with no way of getting home,0

322975,My son was admitted to Harvey ward. At the time he had bone cancer. He was 21 at the time. He had his leg amputated 8 weeks before hand. He had chronic diarrhoea and sepsis. We were told that he was going to die and to say goodbye there was nothing more they could do for him. We asked for him to be put in intensive care. But they said it was wasting a bed as he was dying. They needed the beds for people they could save and they couldn't save him. We eventually got him transferred to university collage hospital London and they made complaints. We were told that they were reviewing him and would have put him in intensive care if he had got worse. How much worse did he have to get than dying? Luckily the care he received at UHC saved his life. He was in intensive care there for over a month. They saved his life. I fell 100 % sure if we had left him in princess Alexandra hospital he would not be here now. We trusted them once more a year later and they messed up again. I have no trust in them at all.,1

My overall experience at the hospital has been good with jolly staff helping me through my operations.

Treatments offered robotic surgery, or radiotherapy and hormone therapy. In view of the time taken to diagnose my cancer, the lack of personal contact. I have seen 4 different consultants, and a nurses to discuss my treatment options. I decided to seek a second opinion from a private prostate clinic. The outcome is, I shall be having my prostate removed in November in a private clinic. I have been fortunate to be able to afford private health. In my experience of life, one of the keys running a successful business is customer service. If you do not offer the customer a good service you do not have any customer and your business goes bust.

323700,I phoned 111 service on 23rd October for my 4 year old son. They sent out an ambulance as he was presenting as needing immediate care and there were no appointments in my area. The paramedic decided he needed to be admitted due to his presentation. He was given oxygen in the ambulance and we were then left my ambulance staff on a corridor near a desk with police officers and men that had been fighting. We were seen by a nurse then left in a tiny waiting area. Hours later a doctor saw him. They looked at his ears and throat - gave him the briefest check over and asked us to do a dioralyte challenge. It was now very late. My son was tired and didn't want to drink the dioralyte. When we saw the doctor again. In a public waiting room they suggested because he hadn't been sick or had diarrhoea after drinking 30ml of dioralyte he was not unwell. The Dr told me he was clearly a well child and even though he hadn't been unwell for at that point 9 days. With a temp exceeding 38.5 degrees at all times. They thought it best that I just give back to back paracetamol and ibuprofen until he improved. This was the early hours of the morning. My car was at home with my partner and 1 year old and they suggested I get a taxi back to cleckheaton. It no wonder transpires after my son being admitted to Dewsbury children's assessment and seeing the most fantastic doctor he actually hadn't pneumonia. Had the first doctor even given us the time of day this could maybe have been avoided. But because he wasn't presenting as he had at home and in then ambulance they told me he was not an unwell child. A&e that night was a shambles. Not once was my son offered a drink.,1

About 10am.in the morning a nurse came and tried to put a cateter on without success but stressing my husband out in the process so he started having breathing difficulties again. This was however ignored by the staff moving him so he was moved on a ward and left there without any monitoring nobody came to see.my husband whilst he was gasping for air until his heart stopped. He was then resuscitated and then spent 6 weeks in ICU and is still not recovered being now badly treated on a ward in Canterbury hospital as he now have to have dialysis.

324859,My issue is with the lack of car parking spaces since the closure of the land (used for parking) opposite the hospital. This land has stood vacant for several months now and what a complete waste of resource. Surely BHRUT can purchase this land and the money accrued from car parking charges would surely cover the purchase price in a short time. The queue for the car park is lengthy and I am sure there have been numerous delays in attendance for appointments. I would like to know what BHRUT plan to do about this situation. We are not all able to use public transport otherwise we would.,0

I personally think he was treat and I was spoken too dreadfully and would not use these nurses or doctors for anything",0
325095,"We first attended paediatric A&E where my son was diagnosed with appendicitis and operated promptly by a fantastic tall surgeon who only used one entry point for his laparoscopic procedure! Unfortunately my son was sick as he had ruptured his appendix and the surgeon had to suck the pus out to make my son better. After the operation, my son was looked after also by the staff on the paediatric ward where my wife and I took turns to sleep with him whilst he recovered. The staff were attentive to his needs, gave him his antibiotics and pain killers when appropriate and treated my son with compassion. He made a slow but steady recovery and was discharged 2 days after his admission. We were very blessed to be cared for by the paediatric surgeon, doctors and staff and are so relieved and glad that today my son is well and almost back to normal just 4 weeks after his operation.",0
325180,"my daughter in law had our grandson by c section at the end of october,all seemed well until 3 days later with severe back pain,she was admitted back onto the baby ward and was told she had kidney failure,had a cathetor fitted and intravenous fluids,1 bag of fluids.By sunday another doctor realised the fluids should have been on constantly and a bag was fitted and was continued throughout her 4 day stay.on the 3rd day a doctor asked if the baby was drowsy as the painkillers were coming through the breastmilk which the midwife had said wouldnt happen.so not only do i suspect they damaged my daughter in law,they almost poisoned my grandson.During that time she was told she would need a blood tranfusion,dialysis,but by day 4 her bloods had returned to a level which meant she could be discharged and continue her care as a day patient for daily blood tests.we still dont know what they have done and more worrying is that the so called doctor carrying out the c section was been instructed throughout the procedure.says just about everything.Read reviews before you put your loved ones into their hands,they are playing at it !!",1
325374,"I am really annoyed,my elderly mother attended the xray dept on the instructions of her doctor. She has visited her GP less than 10 times in 50 years but has developed afew problems after the death of my father. She attended with my husband and elderly aunt to assist her in undressing. She was called by a nurse who tutted very loudly because it took my mother so long to get up and shuffle to follow them. The nurse asked my mother what she had told the doctor to get the doctor to refer her for the xrays ,she couldnt answer as she is a very nervous person and was very stressed, my aunt tried to explain but was abruptly cut off and told she wasnt being spoken to, my mother was, my husband then intervened. Where was the dignity and respect, I know this is a good hospital after the death of my father but some staff let it down.",0
325602,"The treatment has been excellent. The nurses are very careful in all aspects of hygiene and infection control with scrupulous attention to patient identification. Clinic appointments have been mostly on time with opportunities to change times.There is a variation in the customer focus of the reception staff. some are excellent, others less so. More good consistency is required in this area. Specialist clinicians, Consultant and Registras, have always given appropriate time in clinic. I feel it is somewhat difficult to contact the clinicians outside prescribed appointments although the secretary is extremely competent and helpful. The specialist nurses are always very helpful but sometimes one has to wait a day or so for a response to a telephone call. Letters from Consultants take an extremely long time to reach the patient; about 20 days.This is unacceptable in the long term. Some of the estate needs refreshing and update (lots of tape on floors which are in some places uneven) but toilets are generally well kept and clean",0
326161,"My elderly parents were taken by ambulance (in response to an emergency call) to A&E. After taking a ridiculously long way round to the hospital, they finally arrived only to be dumped in A&E. My father was in severe rectal pain due to a blockage. He suffers ffrom chronic heart failure and is extremely frail. He was left in a wheelchair in his pyjamas among the walking wounded of Hull. There appeared to be no effort to prioritise cases (perhaps a way of making sure everyone is seen within target as opposed to those who need urgent treatment being seen first and minor injuries having to wait longer, possibly beyond target). The brusque, couldn't give a fig nurse told them that they would see a doctor within half an hour. After three hours, my Father could no longer bear the pain of sitting on a hard wheelchair and they left, paying £25 for a taxi. My Father's problem is not resolved and he now has a fear of having to attend A&E. Absolutely appalling!",1
326116,When approaching the main car park on the left or north side going down hill; one is confronted with a huge notice board saying - staff parking on the left. This catches one's attention. I suggest one under it saying visitors on the right. There is in comparison a small board on the left hand side of the road saying - public car park. We were confused by the large and more prominent notice and so drove straight on to car park G. This involved 8 minutes walk back to the main entrance. Your observations on this suggestion would be much appreciated. Where is the proper box for entering this reply?,0
326884,"I just wanted to say how impressed I was, with my recent experience of PRH. I saw my GP on Tuesday night and was referred for a chest x-ray. The referral was instantaneous - I was told I could call in at anytime, Monday to Friday between 9am and 4pm. Luckily, I was finishing work early the next day, so I called in. I fully expected the process to take ages, but I was back to my car within 30 minutes of parking (so I didn't even have to pay to park).",0
327252,"Very very dissatisfied with the level of treatment my grandson received at lister,having being admitted due to low oxygen levels he was seen by a paediatrician who said he was suffering with a bacterial infection and needed antibiotics every 8 hours and had to be kept in overnight (it was midnight)My daughter stayed with him and I went home with my 4yr old granddaughter, it was most distressing for her she didn't like leaving her mother and brother. I returned following day just in time to witness a consultants visit, they said it was a viral infection and promptly advised nebuliser... it didn't work! When I asked the nurse about his antibiotics they replied that they were sure he had had another course, I asked them to check they never came back to me, I tracked them down and asked had they checked, they replied that he hadn't had another dose of antibiotics, I asked why not as his condition was not getting better, they said they would consult another paediatrician thst was on duty and came back half an hour later and said the consultant had advised he be given antibiotics!! 5 hours later than he should have received them!!During the rest of the day my 5yr old grandsons condition improved but it was too late for him to go home so he was detained in hospital another night!The following morning he was allowed home and I met my daughter and grandson outside the hospital as she couldn't stand being there inside the hospital a moment longer. I might add that iam going to elevate this as a formal complaint to all the necessary authorities as this practice cannot continue!!",1
327391,"My mother was in Frimley Park hospital 2 years ago. They lady in the next bed was sleeping. Her family were called and they were told she was dying. There was no privacy, I could hear everything. When it was meal time they put it on a table by her bed and tried to wake her up to eat it. Later they tried to wake her for a blood test - one nurse told another they had to do it, she was on the list, otherwise they would get a bad audit. Later an elderly man came in and sat by her bed. He held her hand a few times and spoke to her, but she was sleeping. Eventually a nurse came by and realised she had died. They put the screens around the bed and walked off. No one offered the man any words of comfort. Eventually he got up and walked off. It was the most awful scene totally lack any care or compassion.",1
327633,Since being diagnosed type 1 diabetic in February and also being very needle phobic this hospital literally saved my life 3 times when I was admitted with DKA. Not once did anyone not show compassion or care. The staff are literally run off their feet. I witnessed them barely having a break because they actually care. The nursing staff especially who work tirelessly. And one itu registrar who was just brilliant when I was in resus who needed to do arterial blood gas after I had it before was so kind and patient (with me being a wimp). They explained it all after previous bad experiences and numbed my arm before doing it I didn't feel it. Im so grateful we have this. Don't knock this place.,0

327914,"I was extremely impressed by the services provided by the breast care clinic. I was seen only 9 days following a gp referral. I received information via the post prior to the appointment outlining what would happen on the day and most importantly highlighting the expected length of the visit could be up to 3 hours.. Managing expectations and allowing adequate child care preperations to be made. The clinic environment is comfortable and clean. Each and every member of staff I came into contact with was pleasant and professional. I was there the full 3 hours but this included a consultant consultation, scan and procedure.. A complete 'one stop shop' . I am used to being a health care professional within the NHS but rarely have I been on the receiving end of the care.. I will with no reservation be recommending the breast clinics services to family and friends.",0
328025,"On admission to hospital my disabled child had her medication locked away (clearly good practice). The concern was she had suffered a stroke following an epileptic seizure. The medication helps prevent seizures - she takes 10 medications per day in 4 doses, 2 of the medications were unlicensed, so dispensed directly to us from GOSH. On discharge, staff refused to return the medication before it was prescribed by pharmacy. During the day my daughter had been sick and therefore still required 10 doses however we had no medication until someone could return to the ward and collect it after pharmacy prescribed it. Pharmacy could not prescribe it so we were just given it back. Withholding medication from a disabled child is good practice how? Particularly as the medication was to prevent epilepsy and that was the reason she suffered from paralysis in the first place. Care on the ward was otherwise exemplary.",1
328107,"Just spent my third visit in a month in cardiology for chest pain and stent insertion . The care, concern, actions and respect shown by the team are examplary. The nurses, regardless of grade work as a team which projects both professionalism combined with friendliness , a difficult mixture to achieve. Everyone involved in my care showed the highest possible standards of warmth and understanding during a worrying time. Consultant, nursing and auxiliary staff should be complimented on their projection of a superb team working together in the best interest of patient care.",0
328335,"My elderly mother in her nineties was sent to Accident and Emergency following a fall at home. As with previous admissions Paramedics/ambulance staff were superb-efficient, courteous and so kind, however the care in A and E was absolutely dire. She had to wait for several hours on a trolley, eventually in a cubicle. Nobody enquired about her pain level or state of hydration.There was no eye contact whatsoever from passing staff and we were totally ignored. She managed to balance on a bedpan in severe pain and we were told by nursing staff that it was therefore extremely unlikely that she had a fracture. I reminded them that she previously fractured her hip and so several hours later an XRay was taken with a proven fracture. Staff were keen to discharge her home immediately and she was treated very badly fror such a frail lady. I fully understand the financial problems and stress on the NHS having spent my whole working life there but am ashamed at the state of affairs today.",0

Everybody in this department is extremely helpful, professional and courteous. I have never had a bad experience and I appreciate they staff must be under particular pressure during busy times. I am always treated in a friendly manner and with a lot of respect. The consultants are always happy to answer my questions. I went for an appointment this morning and I am very happy with the treatment. Please could somebody pass this on to the staff in Clinic 8? Thank you.",0
328392,"My GP told me to attend the X-ray department. I looked on the website to find the opening hours for the X-ray department. Under the heading; 'Departments and Services', there is no mention that there is an X-ray department at the hospital - so no way to find out the opening times. Ok, back to the old way. I telephoned the number for the hospital and the operator told me that they did not know the opening hours for X-ray, but would put me through to the department. the line was busy and they asked if I would hold. I said yes, but after an interminable wait, eventually gave up - my only telephone is a pay as you go mobile, that gives me a limited amout of time for calls each month - certainly not enough to waste time in this manner. My point is; how difficult would it be for the switchbord operator to have a list of the opening times for departments and clinlics? It is absurd that simple information that could be easily given at the first point of contact (the switchboard) is not available. It is equally absurd that staff in the relevant departments waste valuable time giving out times of opening. Finally, a suggestion - put the various opening hours (including visiting hours) on your website, and save us all time and frustration.",0
328380,"My 16 year old daughter was rushed from Harlow hospital who have no out of hours ENT care to Broomfield as she was haemorrhaging from the throat after a Tonsillectomy. While Harlow was faffing she lost around 3 pints of blood and was very poorly. The Doctors and nurses who met us on arrival were absolutely incredible. They were caring, reassuring and did everything they could to make the bleeding stop and help reassure Verity that she was going to be ok. When all failed they got her in for emergency surgery but during the whole episode someone stayed with her. The team in surgery were fabulous, singing as she went under as she had told them she was starting at a musical theatre academy the following week. she came round smiling! Back on the ward the care she received was amazing and when she left and saw the doctor who had helped her throughout she cried with thanks. Thank you !",1

Having previously suffered a kidney infection, I was very aware that the symptoms were identical to the ones I was suffering. When speaking with the doctor this was dismissed and I was advised to take a urine sample to my own GP so that they could decide what antibiotics I should be on. I was prescribed some antibiotics and given no advice on any further care. Just over 24 hours I was admitted to A&E with Sepsis caused from an untreated kidney infection. If this doctor had actually listened to my concerns then I would have been treated properly before I became so ill and hospitalised for over a week.",1

Unfortunately I did not get their name, so much for the Trust's my name is policy, but would like to assure them that acute kidney injury should not be ignored and after a nine hour wait my daughter was finally treated with iv fluids and iv antibiotics and was moved to a ward.

329533,"My son was recently admitted to the Major Trauma Ward following an assault which has left him scared for life. I couldn't fault the care, the nurses were all lovely and the care was amazing. However my son complained to me that he felt very unsafe. He told me that one night he was aware of a gang of boys who forced themselves on to the ward because all the doors on the ward were broken, he overheard the staff complaining that the doors were broken since 2014 but the hospital had still not fixed them. He was terrified the gang of boys had found him and were returning to attack him again. I couldn't sleep at night knowing my son was left exposed. I understand the nurses are not there to fix the doors, but it is really scary to think what may happen to other patients if the doors are broken. I feel sorry for the nurses to have to work in such a dangerous environment",1

The staff member suggested Lewes,which has an all day walk-in unit. They checked this with colleague. Just needed to collect my referral letter.Collected letter at time of booking 9 am, and went to Lewes. Turns out Lewes x ray unit is only open in afternoons!

Given antiemetic by IV at 1930 and seen by Doc at 2000 who ignored family concerns and discharged mum. Said her condition was caused by a reaction to antibiotics she had been prescribed 4 days earlier plus said her blood results were fine. Mum had been vomiting for a few days had been unable to take food, drink or meds! Discharged with cannula in her arm! Vomited throughout the night and was very poorly. GP rang as they were very concerned about the blood results the hospital doctor had been happy with! Mum had been vomiting black smelling liquid and GP requested ambulance with urgent priority. Readmitted to A&E with original cannula in place, eventually new one fitted and old one removed, all IT systems down so confusion all round. Various tests carried out mum unable still to have food or drink, different doctor from one we had been dealing with throughput day came to see mum and clearly had not read all the information and wanted to discharge mum saying that although she was still clearly unwell we should take her home as she was in more risk stopping in due to serious risk of infection!! We explained in detail what had gone on X did they very reluctantly agreed to let her stay. She was moved to EDU at about 0200 and had further vomiting during the night.

330142,"My husband collapsed while in London early this year, he was diagnosed with brain tumours following a biopsy at the London Neurology Hospital and given three months. During this time he had several falls, a consequence of the brain tumours, although he was under Mount Vernon for care on the numerous occasions I had to call out the Ambulance because I had no help and was unable to get him up by myself. Each time he was taken to Stoke Mandeville where they seem to have no understanding of brain tumours and actually smirked and made comments that he was not all there. When he cried owing to their comments they were still amused, making him out to be an idiot. Sometimes he was kept in, we were left waiting hours, often into the early hours, on one occasion it was 2am in the morning. I was assured by staff it was okay for me to go home. Next morning. when I arrived they said he was incontinent, which at that time he was not but had been left unattended after I left and he was not able to call anyone. We had similar experience each time. He got an infection and ended up in hospital for sometime. We were then sent home, being told my husband needed twenty four hour care. No care package was provided and obviously I was not able to cope on my own. It was very sad that someone who had worked so hard all his life achieving so much in his career and for helping others was treated so badly at Stoke Mandeville. The treatment at Mount Vernon, UCH and the Neroly Hospital was so different. He was only young, although the brain tumours affected him, he did understand what was going on at this time.",1

He eventually was given a saline drip and intravenous antibiotics. But only after he deteriorated spectacularly and was choking on his own vomit.At 11pm he was transferred to a holding ward.By then he was extremely poorly and so exhausted he was semi conscious.Staff in this ward showed little compassion or interest in him which saddened me greatly.If he has to return to A&E at some point in the future as an emergency I would be worried about his care.,0

I was called in and seen to on time. The Doctor came in and introduced themself to me by name and shook my hand, they were efficient and friendly. I had to be fitted with a boot for 6 weeks and the nurse who fitted it was so nice and friendly. I was given clear instructions on what to do for the next 6 weeks and what is to happen in the future.

331295,"Dental treatment is often considered to be associated with pain and discomfort, however rest assured, the high standards of patient care available in the Liverpool Dental Hospital will ensure that your visit is both pleasant and above all comfortable. Dental students are trained to be a very high standard of expertise in all aspects of restorative dentistry using the very latest composites for dental restoration you will be delighted with. At all times throughout your treatment plan, a qualified, Senior Dental practitioner will evaluate, guide and advise on the various stages of dental restoration to ensure that the procedures are carried out with accuracy to achieve the best possible end result. Students recognise the importance of reassurance to their patients and explain in some detail the procedures they are about to undertake, monitoring the patient constantly for any signs of anxiety or stress which they quickly respond to. You are in very safe hands when undertaking treatment at the Liverpool Dental Hospital, resulting in exemplary dental health to be proud of. There is always an element of education included in the visit to enable the patient to fully appreciate and understand the procedure carried out and how to avoid the need for repetition, and thus the student expands their knowledge whilst the patient receives professional guidance and advice. The prospect of repeat appointments to complete the advised restorative work should be regarded as a valued opportunity to experience dental care of the very highest level, since time taken is not critical however perfection is high on their list of priorities, as well as patient satisfaction. I have been extremely fortunate to have always been assigned a final year student who carries out the necessary dental work with dedication, a total commitment to achieve impressive end results of their work, and above all a pleasant and comfortable experience in the dental chair. Enjoy your visit to the Dental Hospital, you will be well looked after.",0
331525,"The booking process following a GP referral was efficient and within reasonable timescales. The parking is very convenient, the reception area is comfortable and the team worked well to ensure the appointment was on time. Various staff ensured that I was fully informed about the treatment. After my first appointment I was unlocking my car to leave when a nurse ran out and told me they had capacity to perform a biopsy straight away to save a return visit - excellent service. When the Consultant explained the results they used simple language to outline the condition and the treatment options so I felt involved in the decision making. To conclude the review, I can say that the treatment was effective (and painless) and I would recommend the service to friends and family..",0
331712,"Today me and my family have never been more shocked at the lack of knowledge the staff have leaving us feel completely let down, unsafe, vulnerable and most of all disgusted at this hospital. Today my grandma was rushed into hospital by ambulance as I had suspected she had suffered from a stroke during the night. This morning she was very confused, disoriented and showed many effects and symptoms you would from a stroke such as being paralysed on one side. Prior to the stroke she had lost her balance and fell, hurting her foot. When we arrived at cramlington hospital she was taken away before me or my mam had a chance to even express our concerns about the stroke situation. She had an X-Ray of her foot which was clarified as broken, and given equiptment enabling her to be able to walk around easier at home. We then asked about the stroke we were told that she hadn't suffered one and must of just been in pain because of the foot causing the confusion this morning. We knew this wasn't the case and insisted they checked her out by doing scans or something. 9 and a half hours later she's just got back from her CT scan which has clarified she has in fact had a stroke which could leave lasting damage. If me and my mam hadn't spoke up and insisted further tests were done I dread to think what could of happened to her when she arrived home tonight as she lives alone. I can't believe the lack of communication between staff, the slowness of the staff and most of all what worries me is the lack of knowledge and that I had known my grandma had clearly had a stroke before a ""specialised"" doctor did. Would not recommend to anyone",1

The staff on duty took great care to make sure that I would receive the appropriate treatment, going through the safety question with me more than once. The radiographer was friendly, yet very professional. Everything about the scan was explained to me in advance, and I was given the opportunity to ask questions.

She was left in a dirty night clothes that she had on for three days and nights. They did change her when I told them two. She was so constipated and severely dehydrated she had to go to A&E for emergency care which I had already told the nursing staff that my mom needed to be on a medical ward.

And she had a tongue tied which was not noticed only I did as a mother and had have it done privately. My experience in the neonatal unit was good all Dr and nurses was helpful. When I was on the victoria ward I had bad experience and I was having contractions I was left crying alone and nobody came to see me. And when ever I buzzed nobody came.

Almost every member of the staff made every effort to make sure a smooth experience. The staff can do with little more help from people looking at future improvements. 1) The IT systems need to talk between various departments so that the mid-wife can reduce time spent on duplicating notes manually. 2) The shifts seem very long, I have never seen someone working so hard for so long. As per studies chances for error increase after 6 hours of work. The shifts here are 12 hours excluding hand-overs.",0
333895,"Daughter has been having ongoing tests for colitis, already had a sigmoidoscopy at Worcester which was inconclusive for Crohns. Was referred for another with biopsy and offered sedation as she found first procedure distressing although found staff kind at Worcester. She had cannula put in on ward on morning of procedure, signed forms agreeing to sigmoidoscopy with sedation and was taken through - the dr refused to sedate as 'they don't sedate' didn't consider my daughters distress and questioned why she was crying during procedure. She felt dismissed and violated. It wasn't what she was prepared for, she had a fissure healing just prior to this and was in a lot of pain. I was so furious by the doctor's attitude and lack of communication.",1
342190,"My father was admitted to A&E suffering from severe mental health issues on 12th December. The first doctor asked him a series of questions - including, if you could harm yourself right now - would you? My father answered yes, he would. We waited 15 hours for a bed and finally left, having given phone numbers in case of an emergency. Horrifyingly, when my mother returned to visit my father on the same ward, she noticed he had bloody wounds on both wrists. She was then told that my father had been able to leave his bed, wander to a tea point, pick up a sharp object (staff seemed unclear if this was a knife or scissors) and cut both of his wrists. Nobody rang to tell us this had happened. I'm absolutely appalled that my father came to further harm whilst under the care of this hospital, having made it clear from the outset exactly what his state of mind was in terms of self harm. Disgusting.",1
334252,I went the first time by Ambulance only to return a week later by car. On both occasions I were doubled up in the worst pain possibly imaginable. The first time my 10yr old daughter were with me waiting in a corridor with me while I screamed in agony and vomited continually. She were crying frightened experiencing severe panic attacks has she has ptsd. A member of my family came to collect her by this time I were on my hands and knees in agony. Eventually I went in a cubical both times. first time I waited hours before being given adequate pain relief eventually I went on a ward. The second time were worse than the first repeatedly being told although I were screaming in pain I couldn't have any more pain relief until a certain time had passed. Up on a ward hours later I continued to scream in sheer agony crawling around the floor crying help me. After being told nothing more they could do as there were only one doctor who were busy with more ill patients I would just have to wait. Eventually my sister went to the front reception desk asked to see the site manager. Hours later I eventually were seen by a doctor who administered the correct pain relief I needed. 2 days later I had an operation to remove my gallbladder. I will never forget that pain back braking constant agony for hours on end probably over12 hrs screaming on the floor. surely this isn't right.,1

The plan changed that he was going to rehab then home which was fine but unfortunately he rapidly deteriorated and his organs began to fail and he passed away. We were told he had pneumonia and this was cause of death. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't irrelevant my father has passed away. Up to this point he had received adequate care. However, it seemed as soon as he passed it felt like he was nothing. we spent days tracking his belongings down. they were flung In a bag and chucked on the floor and had been walked all over. His teeth glasses and hearing aid were just chucked in the bag, rude staff as we interrupted their chat and giggle time, how bad of us.

From first examination through to surgery a time frame of some 28 days I was amazed at the swift, professionalism, politeness of the whole procedure. I was at all times assured that I would be kept in the loop as to the program and alternatives together with in depth clarification on any area of concern. The punctuality of all appoints was most impressive and on the actual day of admission all staff were most kind and professional and relieved me of worries and concerns. I can only award 5 stars for my own personal experience. Well done.",0

336270,"The surgery is a very pleasant place to visit; I particularly enjoy the music that plays when you are in the waiting room as it is incredibly relaxing and regardless of your reason for visit, it feels like your stresses disappear. The waiting area is very clean and despite the seating having been in the surgery for many years now, it is still very well upholstered which is a testament to the good job carried out by the cleaner(s). The staff on reception are professional, yet pleasant and respect your right to a private word if you do not wish to be mentioning an issue within the waiting area. The only thing I would perhaps recommend would be a glass like shield from floor to ceiling, complementing the curvature of the desk to block eavesdropping from those situated within the waiting room area as it is easy to pick-up on other people's information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and ailments/medication.",0

After waiting almost 4 hours to be seen my daughter was then told to ""carry on doing what she was doing"" which was giving her calpol every 4 hours and her blue inhaler as and when she needed it by the nurse and told she didnt need to see a Dr and gave my daughter a printout of the doses for my granddaughters asthma pump. Again that night my granddaughter was sick in the night and didnt settle properly. My daughter took the children home the next day and got an emergency appt to see the Dr who was amazed my grandaughter hadnt been given antibiotics for a severe chest infection and that she could hear the nasty crackle when she walked in, and also prescribed a preventative inhaler.

The staff come , briefing given on hand over on every patient. Each member of staff know exactly what their shift entails and get on with their work. They are all polite, attentive and make you feel like an individual whose needs are paramount . The staff communicate with each other with respect.

337143,My former husband was treated well in Aand E. He had terminal cancer and died within a week of admittance.The staff at Mary Seacole ward urgent care were excellent once admitted and he died with dignity. The nurses and consultant were caring and sensitive to the needs of the family. He died n 11/11 2016.The main problem was in the CDU where he was mainly treated by a junior doctor. His palliative care was not good as they don't work at weekends. The junior doctors often didn't return phone calls and he remained in the CDU for 4days as they stated that they couldn't get a bed in a ward. Over the weekend hot food was not available and the staff seemed very laid back not assisting him to sit up and eat. It was quite clear initially that they intended to send him home with more care although on the 4th day it transpired that he needed fluid draining from the chest wall .By then he was too critically ill to have it and died. It was cold in the CDU and not a place for a critically ill man for 4days.,1

Not possible to hang on as people like me have to get ready for/travel to work. Slot release is confusing told 1 week in advance they're open yet was told only open up until Friday (3 days from call) On line booking is fine but if you forget password then you have to come in to surgery with ID and fresh application form.,0

338133,I have a severe phobia of needles/blood tests and was treated appallingly today by a phlebotomist. They were flippent of my fear and after I asked them if it was nearly over they rudely informed me that nothing was coming out and that it was my fault because I had moved which was not the case. They informed me that they would have to do it again to which I refused as my anxiety was so high. This was poor treatment anyway but for someone with a phobia this was my nightmare come true.

338597,"My daughter was admitted to A&E in extreme pain at 8am. She was 9 weeks pregnant. The pain in her right side was so severe that I could hear her screaming in agony before I even found her in a cubicle. It was 10 20am when I arrived. They left her in agony for over two hours, with just gas and air, saying she was exaggerating the pain. At one point one of the nurses tossed her a blanket and said they were going for a break. I took control as her poor husband was in tears, he was so traumatised. Finally they decided to scan her. They found a huge cyst on her ovary. By the time they decided that perhaps this was an emergency, she was taken for surgery. Too late. The ovary had twisted and died basically, and they had to remove it and part of her Fallopian tube. She was discharged two days later, they made her get out of bed and left her in a chair, until I could arrive to pick her up. She could barely walk, and no wheelchair was offered. Since the major surgery not a single person has called her, no follow up appointments have been organised and she has yet to even talk it through with the surgeon. This is like a third world hospital and is a disgrace to the NHS, I literally haven't seen a Vet allow an animal to suffer like she was forced to. She lost her entire ovary and part of her Fallopian tube, and that 5 to 6 hour delay they made her endure I am sure is to blame for this avoidable tragedy. She wishes to remain anonymous at the moment, as unfortunately she has to have her baby there (if it has survived the trauma of her surgery). Naturally she's terrified and cannot afford to have her baby privately, so she doesn't want to be treated as appallingly again and is scared of what the repercussions would be if she complained at the moment. She called me in hysterics both nights she was there, to say how cruel and awful the nurses were being to her. And believe me my daughter is a brave, polite and well educated girl and not prone to exaggeration. She had her first baby at Chelsea Westminster and was treated beautifully. Now she's moved near to this hospital, that's her only real option. I will be taking action, but I must wait until she's had her baby, and pray that the maternity unit is not as horrendous as the department she was in. I'm afraid, she's terrified and her husband is beside himself with worry.",1

340334,"I recently attended the hospital for a colonoscopy, and I was so impressed with every aspect of the care process, I wanted to feed back my comments. From the initial appointment with the nurse to explain the whole procedure, through to the actual procedure on Monday, I have been very happy with the amount of time taken to explain every aspect, and the helpfulness and friendliness of all members of staff. This includes all the useful and informative written material about the process and the preparation required before procedure itself. What can be a slightly unpleasant prospect, was made as easy and comfortable a process as possible by the sheer humanity of the staff involved. The National Health Service receives an unfair amount of criticism for what in my experience has been mostly very good service, and in this particular case, I can't think of any particular ways private treatment would have been superior.",0

340694,"Great experience from start to finish. ON arrival a lovely ambulance person offered to give us a wheel chair, so I could wheel my wife into the A&E reception. From there the reception staff (and the duty nurse on the reception desk) were very quick and efficient, especially for a Saturday night! We only had to wait for 30 minutes to be seen by a Doctor. The Doctor was very professional and knew exactly what the issue was, but decided to have an X-Ray, just to e safe, as my wife, Terezie, was in a lot of pain. X-Ray was taken within 10 minutes, and results back to us another 10 minutes or so, couldnt belive how quick the whole process was. All in al it was a highly professional and stress free experience.

341247,"My mum who has Alzheimer's was admitted to a Surgical ward with an obstruction in her bowel. As it so happened she did not need an operation in the end. As her daughter and main Carer I had grave concerns about how my mother would cope in hospital. Recent negative press surrounding the undignified treatment of people with dementia in some hospitals had done little to allay these fears. However I have nothing but praise for the way my mum was looked after during her stay. Mum was treated by a team who not only displayed great professionalism but also treated mum with the utmost dignity and respect. Mum may not remember why she was in hospital but what she does remember is that ""everyone was lovely"", and for that I am very grateful. Well done to ALL the staff on ward 15 A for making it a dementia friendly environment.",0

They then told her daughter her mum have left her. Mind you her mum had a stroke a couple of years ago and struggles with low and high blood pressure. Then when we came to give her some food, as we were scared she would end up in hospital, they came and told us to leave, that would have been fine, but they brought two nurses ( one was lurking behind the other) like they needed to protect themselves from us. We had shown no violent behaviour.

The A&E department for very good, unfortunately a lot of the diagnosis was done in the A&E instead of the GP surgery. The people who dealt with his lung cancer were fairly good as they made several attempts to get a biopsy but unfortunately failed. The problem was with the bowel specialist who was disrespectful and uncooperative, they would glibly talk about him ""dropping off his perch"" and when he got a second opinion from another bowel specialist in a different area they incredulously refused to deal with him again. He did not receive the proper medication and instead went to Christies in Manchester who did a proper job",0

My heavily pregnant sister had to lie on the dirty floor being violently sick in front of a room of people for over 3 hours.

Lovely welcome at O/P reception, seen by Dr who was simply lovely, listened, provided me with detailed information regarding my results and proposed medication change and follow up, rarely have I felt so positive regarding a consultation. On the way out in reception, clinical staff had various stalls regarding the work of the unit and promoting care and dignity on the Wards and specific conditions i.e. Lung cancer and its care. Discussion was encouraged by cakes and treats and it was really interesting to find out about the values staff are implementing on the wards.

However I received excellent and efficient service from all staff at the hospital. From the carpark staff and volunteers in corridors helping patients navigate the routes through the hospital during the current building works (not sure I needed 2 copies of the 3 page letter about carparking and access though- rather a waste of admin resources), through to the reception staff, HCA and excellent consultation with the Consultant. I was seen on time, I was listened to, was examined, and we discussed and agreed options together. The Consultant then dictated the follow up letter to my GP so I knew excatly what they were suggesting. I just hope that the next steps are undertaken as efficiently. Well done NHS!

The CT Unit used the landline telephone and required the client to answer several questions and key answers onto the keypad. This was unsatisfactory for several reasons - First it required the client to be available. Second, it required the person answering to key in answers before revealing the message of an appointment. Third, it was clumsy and needed unnecessary intervention. There should be a single consistent method of MDGH providing reminders.",0
346264,My Dad was sent into hospital from his care home he was assessed in casualty and my sister was told he could go home if he had transport. alas she didn't so she was told he would be kept in overnight. Dr in casualty said they didn't like admitting people with dementia wich my Dad has. However in the morning even though he'd been told he could go home the night before another Dr came round and decided they would keep him in to do a scan however we wasn't told the scanner was broken so he was kept in in the end for 11 days. I wasn't able to get into see my Dad due to ill health and had to keep ringing up. But I wasn't told anything in fact I was told if I wanted to know more I would have to make an appointment myself to see Dads Dr to find out what was going on and what they had found wrong with him to delay his stay even though I explained to them I could not get in to see him.. He was finally sent back to his Care home 11 days later after being dehydrated whilst in there he had a catheter put in halfway through his stay and he had a drip in because I was told he needed a boost that's all. He might have needed the boost as they called it because they didn't monitor his fluid intake. But why the catheter. However when he came home he had to have his Go out because he had an infection with the catheter. In the meantime I have visited him in the care home and h my God he is a poorly frail old man now after nearly 2 weeks in there. He can hardly walk he has gone very twitchy and withdrawn into himself. It is upsetting seeing him like this now even though he has dementia he was quite a jolly man before he went in there. The ambulance crew put on his report about him being so jolly. 2 weeks being back so far he has not improved any I think he has been traumatised. Unfortunately he has received another appointment for an angiogram I hope he dosnt have to stay in its supposed to be done in outpatients but when they see the state of him now they might try to admit him.I am absolutely dreading it. I don't think he would survive another time in Tameside Hospital again the way he is now it is so upsetting seeing him in this tragic state.,1
346314,My mum was admitted to frimley park hospital 7weeks ago in dec 2016 with a bladder infection. Since then the drs diagnosed blood vessles pushing on part of the brain which operates speech memory and communication. Operation would have caused a major stroke. She has been put into the dementia ward which I think is wrong. My stepdad is is the only person at home to look after her and he suffers with a bad hip not able to walk well. The hospital want to discharge mum but she also has odema in legs which have swollen up twice size because the hospital refused to treat them .She is 18stone for to the fluid in the legs. She has been assessed by the social services and said they could get her into upton hospital to help her legs but frimley park hospital have refused. I want to help my mum but feel ithat the hospital is being uncooperative. Where do I go now. I would not recommend Frimley Park Hospital they don't care about people from the experience I've had with my mum.,1
346357,"My husband was taken by ambulance to the RUH after suffering severe chest pains. 10 minutes after arriving we were informed he had suffered a heart attack and he was fitted with stents within 30 minutes of arrival. Stayed in CCU for a week and received excellent care. Staff were excellent not only with my husband but with me and our children. Unfortunately he suffered another heart attack a few weeks later and once again the speed in which he was seen to was excellent. Stents had collapsed due to medication not working but quickly sorted. Unfortunately his heart was damaged and now has heart failure. Attended cardiac rehab for 8 weeks which gave him some confidence back but since then he hasn't been seen and we thought he would have had an outpatients appointment by now, 7 months later. Wondering if we should call up to see if this is usual or not.",0
346576,"I have been visiting an elderly gentlemen friend who had suffered a stroke and had been transferred from B2 to A12 until a care package had been arranged prior to discharge. I arranged my visits to coincide with meal times so I could assist him with his meals. Some of the staff were very offhand and my friend confided that he found it very difficult to understand what they were saying and if you asked for help they were quite offhand. I observed a patient opposite my friend who was blind and deaf and when he asked for assistance and none was forthcoming, so I ended up feeding him. On the day of discharge my friend looked dishevelled and unshaven, even though the ward had plenty of notice.",0
347577,"My husband, absolutely appalling treatment in Bedford Hospital. Not only did he lose six or seven stone through not being fed properly. His treatment was appalling I have dozens of photographs showing the bruises made by the orderly, when nurses tore off plasters and other incidents. He went into Bedford North to recuperate and come home. Three days later he was readmitted into ""killgrim ward"". Two months later after catching infections he had an above knee amputation. When I complained to them and also to the ombudsman they said I wasn't telling the truth, despite the photos and dictaphone messages. I believe the hospital lied to the ombudsman even to the point that their death certificate says one thing and they say it is impossible. The food at the hospital is a disgrace. They didn't make up special nutritional drinks that I had taken in or warm up soup. I will never forgive this hospital nor staff nor the disgraceful food nor anything about the hospital for the death of my husband in such appalling circumstances. My photos of a pool of blood were just considered to be slight seepage. Enormous bruises and I mean enormous were considered to be delicate skin, ripping off plasters and taking skin and hair off with it, seemed to be par for the course. Filthy dirty cannulas shown in a photograph, just my imagination.",1
348030,"My 92 year old disabled father was brought in during early hours of today after falling out of bed and a care worker calling an ambulance. Neither of my parents wanted him to come to hospital but as the caring ambulance staff explained he had a bump to the head and therefore they felt he had to go in. My dad obliged. The staff who saw him were pleasant and luckily there wasn't any further complications after observation of a few hours. He was returned home in the afternoon. He arrived home naked except for incontinence pants which had not been changed during his stay so he was therefore also sodden. Whilst I appreciate that there is enormous pressure on staff I find it very upsetting that a 92 year old man who arrived in his pyjamas was returned naked, cold and very damp. I think it is such a shame that dignity is stripped away and that the lack of sympathy/empathy shown emphasised the decline in NHS services.",1
348031,"This is how good the NHS is ... My GP recommended that I should have an endoscopy on Monday 13th Feb 13th, On Wednesday 15th I got a phone call telling me that if I could get to The Wharfedale unit on Thursday they could complete the procedure. Amazing what a service! I have just had it done, straight in, lovely staff, brilliant explanations and coverage of the procedures, very reassuring, the consultant a top guy, very informative and provided me with great confidence. After the procedures the results were fully explained and the Staff Nurse, provided me with a superb informative and helpful discharge.

350041,"This relatively new unit works in a cohesive and effective way despite the pressures of a hing level of patient attendance. All the staff are committed and work hard to support the patients and each other. A couple of observations: Please review the monitor alarms overnight. They are constantly sounding day and night. Please remember that people are trying to sleep overnight. The nurses station is right outside the bay doors and voices carry. Please reconsider using trolleys in the bay. I realise that this is supposed to be a short quick turnaround unit, however a trolley is not appropriate for overnight, even a high grade trolley is to narrow and too short. This was AAU which does not appear on your drop down list below",0
347969,"During my surgery last February (2016) in Westmoreland Street I was stuck by the value statements on the wall (Safety, Kindness, Teamwork and Improving) and I wondered if this amounted to the usual business speak and platitudes, or did you actually live these values. My interest in this is because I work in a Business Development unit Further Education supporting business start-ups and business growth through skills, knowledge and technology transfer programmes. In my role I work with many businesses and I see many Mission Statements and Value Propositions that are just words on paper and I was curious to see how this played out in reality. In the main my post-operative treatment was at UCLH Euston Road and again I was curious to see if these values were owned by staff in a bigger setting. I was, and still am impressed and delighted that every member of staff I came in contact with, in both sites, from front reception to cleaning, portering, nursing, surgical and clinical care lived and breathed these values making my experience a very positive one.",0
348661,"Further to my previous review of this morning, feel I must add that the service we received from the nurses when we finally got to them was really great! Very kind, caring, efficient and well-explained - we know what to expect and where to go from here and feel fully informed. However, the lack of communication and co-ordination at front of house has meant that we have wasted a total of >5 hours in the waiting room over the last 48 hours, which was not at all necessary and really lets the whole service down.",0
349133,"Fantastic department, excellent service from referral by GP to the efficient model of care given today during my efficient, consultation, investigative procedures and treatment. 2 weeks from GP appointment to clinic visit, reducing time spent worrying and anxiety increasing. Appointment today was scheduled for 09:30, was seen by doctor, who recommended investigative procedures, including mammogram and ultrasound scan. Luckily for me investigations revealed a large cyst which was then drained during ultrasound scan, back to see doc for another consultation and further advice and out of the unit by 10:40! Well done guys, you should be proud, and not just for your efficiency and effectiveness, all members of staff were caring, courteous, compassionate, treated me with dignity and respect making me feel comfortable at all times.

349074,"The mechanism to make and amend the appointments by email was easy and efficient. It may have been helpful to have some indication of likely time at the appointment due to the high cost of local car parks. I spent £6.50 and in the event was out in a shorter timescale in spite of a predicted 'up to 60 minute' waiting time. Filling forms seemed very bureaucratic and question what happens to this information afterwards. X-ray staff very congenial and put me at ease. The Consultant was extremely polite, helpful and knowledgeable. I was reviewed, discharged and home within an hour and a half.",0

I have been a patient with here for almost 20 years starting with them at their previous site of St Marks Road . I have seen year on year improvements in the service offered starting from a baseline of very good ! All the staff are friendly and accommodating. Appointments are well organised both for routine and emergency. Whatever slot you are given you are seen exactly on time and dealt with in a very caring manner whatever the issue . The practice offers blood tests / smears and a range of other services which has made my life much easier than heaving to travel outfsife of my local area .

Whilst under ist department was told she was pathetic and just playing games then she was autistic then she was not then she was the same with the depression and eating disorder when she wanted to talk she was then told not to as it was like a scab if you pick at it it will keep bleeding.

351293,I have found everyone I have met on the team to be helpful and professional. It is great to have a very knowledgeable team of staff. The whole process can seem quite slow but this is necessary for the types of operations performed. My only negative would be that you are not made aware of the timescale from referal to operation (I know this varies from person to person ) but a list of the types of appointments you will need before surgery would be helpful to prepare people for the wait. I am pre op so unable to comment on aftercare. Overall extremely thankful for the dedication from the staff.,0

They spoke loudly in the night so she couldn't sleep, told her they wanted to push her out of the ward after having GA they didn't even ask how she was getting home after just having GA.

352810,"Very good: Over many years my family have used MK Hospital. Our experience is that it has improved to a point where care is reliably good, at times excellent, across a variety of departments. This is particularly commendable given the constant pressure on a crowded, complex site. My family comprises 4 generations, age range 5 to 96 so our experience covers a wide range of clinical needs departments, including Urgent Care and A&E. Poor: Our only gripe is about car parking, which is expensive, at times difficult to access and with poor and unreliable payment facilities, systems and equipment. With very elderly family members, the bus is not a realistic access mode, car is essential.",0

From the outset everyone was more than willing to listen and the process of scheduling the surgery was a great example of high quality, polite and understanding whilst highly efficient teamwork with great cooperation shown to the patient. This excellent start was matched by superb management of the pre operative process, and continued throughout the entire process and beyond.

His ear needed to be injected and he has a terrible needle phobia.He was seen by the doctor and nurse who couldn't have been more understanding. They both kept reassuring him and took pains to make him less fearful. I was really impressed with both of them and particularly the doctor who was amazingly kind & patient with him. My grandson eventually had his ear injected and may need further injctions. The doctor followed up his appointment by phoning to see how he was because they knew how traumatic the appointment was for him. Brilliant service. Thank you NHS,0
353389,"I an writing regarding a visit by my husband on 8th March. He had an accident at work which resulted in his arm being injured. The skin above his wrist was almost all gone leaving open wounds . His arm had been compressed and was covered in dirt & oil. He was seen quickly & it was ascertained that nothing was broken. But that is where the care seemed to stop. He was then discharged. He arrived home having been given a flimsy sling in which to place his arm. His arm had not been cleaned !!! He had open, weeping wounds on his arms & was told it didn't need anything putting on it. To say that I am disgusted is an understatement . We tried our best to clean the wounds ourselves, but they still did not look very clean. Today , after a painful evening & night, he went to see our GP, who was shocked to see the state of his arm & at the lack of treatment. They immediately organised for him to attend the Integrated Centre for treatment. Once there he was treated by a wonderful nurse who was also shocked at what had occurred at the hospital . They were disgusted that the wounds had not been medically cleaned & dressed. They stated that a serious infection could occur if wounds are not cleaned properly & quickly. Let us hope that nothing develops. I am astounded at the lack of care from the hospital , I have always thought that you would receive adequate care when it was necessary , but sadly my husband was sadly let down by the hospital . I shall be submitting a complaint direct to the hospital.",1

355602,"My mum was sent to the Anna Ward after Burton helped her recover from a stroke which left her right side affected. She got hopelessly little rehab for her stroke. I don't think the nurses at Samuel Johnson's had checked her notes either as when a tablet fell out of the right side of her mouth a nurse accused poor mum of spitting it out on purpose! She was also left forgotten in the toilet for half an hour as she couldn't pull the chord with her right hand. Mum suffers from COPD so when she came down with a nasty chest infection they should have put her on antibiotics immediately. Five days later mum was really coughing, with rattling, struggling breathing. The effects of her stroke seemed worse and blood appeared under the skin on the left side of her nose and a bit in her eye. The consultant said she had scratched herself but there was no broken skin. The nurses told mum she couldn't breathe because she was panicking (I heard them tell another poor patient the same). I spent a terrible day trying to convince them that my mum was in a serious condition and she seemed not very responsive and talking and moaning deliriously but nurses said mum was dreaming. In the evening they finally took her blood pressure and then the consultant was called to check my mum's breathing then they called 999 and the angels from Burton came to the rescue. Even with a five hour wait with the ambulance crew the oxygen they gave her made such a difference in a side room at A&E a Doctor diagnosed pneumonia and immediately had her on IV antibiotics. Four days later mum was making a great recovery from Double Pneumonia was breathing normally no cough and ready to be retransferred to Lichfield hopefully not to the same staff but she has the same consultant, and both mum and I have picked up a flu. I am struggling to breathe and my lungs are rattling away and my poor mum must be twice as bad with COPD. My doctor gave me antibiotics they've given my mum cough medicine. Tomorrow I need to go in and kick up a stink to try to save my mum again.",1
354704,"This is my adult daughter's story; she was accompanying my son to the fracture clinic: I thought the doctor was really uncaring and rude and then they took the plaster off and manually manipulated his hand for ten minutes with no pain relief ...he was screaming for ten minutes straight he was in agony and the plaster technician was constantly telling him it was wrong to do it without painkillers and they were crying by the end of it because of how much pain he was in.... and the doctor's excuse was that they had lots of other patients to see. The plaster technician brought in a senior consultant and complained to them and they apologised and said they would have a word, but it's not enough, it was terrible. I've already spoken to PALS but I don't know how much they will do about it My son is scared he will have to see that doctor again. He was nearly throwing up, he was shaking violently and I was having to sit on the floor whilst he was sobbing and screaming to try and help him I was crying. It was horrible to watch The doctor was just tugging on his hand and fingers and seemed not to care at all. They were really reluctant to even give him anything stronger than paracetamol but I insisted and he got a prescription for co codomol I felt helpless while my son was in the most pain I've ever seen anyone in. Now trying to get an alternative appointment under another consultant's care; I can't risk my son seeing this doctor again.

Overall: Staff working well in an obviously outdated building. I believe I have received the best of care.,0
354998,"Yesterday I took my 73 yr old husband with extreme tiredness and shortness of breath. He has previously had blood clots on the lungs , heart attack and a stroke. Also a diabetic. The staff who dealt with him before he saw the doctor could have been robots. They weren't rude but showed no compassion at all . My husband was given a bed and after I had been standing there for a good while I asked if I could sit on a chair nearby, I was told no! So I continued to stand for another half an hour while these 2 chairs remained empty. Then an elderly lady came in with her daughter, of course the old lady sat down and her daughter sat next to her. I on the other hand had to keep standing. I am a fit 70 year old but I was tired from all the standing. The nurses need to have some compassion and learn some good bedside manners. The doctor my husband eventually saw was a very friendly kind person .I went with my daughter the night before as well and once again the nurse she saw was unfriendly and a couldn't careless attitude.",0
355197,"While my mum was in the care of Whiston Hospital I was consistently miss informed of my mums progress by the nursing staff. I was never comfortable with how she was being looked after throughout her stay. I continually questioned the treatment or rather lack of it, but my concerns were dismissed as unfounded. The doctors failed to treat my one of my mums conditions which I believe resulted in her losing her life. The hospital let my mum down and as a result has left four children without our mum, and our children without their grandmother. I felt shocked, saddened and disgusted.",1
355968,"I visited my doctor at Lion Health on Monday morning, 27 February, 2017 who mentioned that I required an x-ray and for me to 'phone to make appointmant at Corbett. I duly 'phoned within half an hour and the x-ray department already had my details on line. Furthermore, they arranged for my x-ray to take place within 48 hours!!! This service would not have been equalled by private treatment. The reason for my review/comments is due to the fact that we are all too ready to knock our NHS, so surely the converse should apply whereby we should sing its praise when a better than first class service is provided. The staff at Corbett were also first class and a very big thank you to you all.",0

I was operated on at midday and kept sedated for 24 hours as stomach was full of poison and hernia was black gratefully to be a tubby as they had to cut over 2 stone of poisend fat away,the staff were absolutely brilliant i can not praise them enough they were fantastic even though i was like looney on morphine the first night.",0
356694,"Arrived 11.30 pm - Child with severe pain and rash on both arms - was seen by midnight by triage nurse. Then followed a lengthy wait -full of a area of sick people all exposed to a 3 yr old who was ill following chickenpox and also recovering from gastro tummy problems exposed to others with infection/illness. I was told children took priority but saw no evidence of this or priority in ensuring my 3 yr old was seen so we could go home and get much needed sleep. I was informed she would be seen quickly. My Daughter had to observe people coming in with police drunk, people laying on chairs in agony crying and a guy with an injured arm covered in blood all very distressing for a 3 yr od.. The area was dirty, uncomfortable and no toys were available for little ones ( obviously no one must bring kids to A&E) Will go to Darlington A&E if needed next time.",0

356724,"My partner was referred to the eye clinic via Spec savers ( ? Macular hole ), just had our 3rd and final visit. We have never waited any longer than 75 minutes, the unit runs extremely well and the staff pleasant and helpful. Earlier laser treatment was carried out to a very high standard we were told .

356834,"My partner had quite a complicated pregnancy which required us to come in for multiple scans and check ups, as well as a very difficult birth, so it was a very stressful period for us. From start to finish, the service we received from the midwifery team was absolutely outstanding. At every stage the staff were kind, patient, and helpful, so I just wanted to thank you for providing such a great service as I understand this must be a huge challenge with so many pressures on the NHS at the moment. Keep up the good work.",0
356852,It is my first time in Hillingdon Hospital. At A&E waiting too long to see doctor while waiting in A&E area it is too cold because an entrance door opened for in and out for peole and No Heating at all. None of raditors works. While I m in Hillingdon Hospital waiting for operate on me. No food and drink at least 8hrs.Cancell. no food and drink at least 8hrs . Cancell again because threater is full.. Empty tomarch all most 24hrs little food and drink your operation is uncertainty. I believe that it is a poor quality service. Need to improve. I would like to see positive outcome rather tell patient to go home and return for confirmation for a day to operate improvement. 1. A&E waiting area for warm and see doctor quickly as possible. 2. Imform patience for date and time to their nees. eg Operation date and time. 3. Consultant regularly visit to imform patience the outcome. I would like to see its improvement for our benefit to work together saving time and money and quality of Hillingdon hospital service can be achieved to a goal. Hope that my feedback can benefits to others. Thanks,0
356876,It says in the write up it costs £1 per hour for parking. This is only true if you stay three hours! I often need to go for a blood test and go at the right time and it takes 20 minutes! I still have to pay £3! Therefor it is a lie to say it cost £1 per hour. Waiting time: I have waited from January 9th until March 15 for my appointment. Nearly 9 weeks! Not 47 days as stated. I must say whenever I come for my blood test most of the staff is very friendly.,0
356882,"This is my second review of the Endoscopy department. I have previously had gastroscopy and endoscopy in this department which was excellent. I have now had another endoscopy and this review again finds the department to be superb. I made a telephone appointment and was sent the required information on preparation for the procedure quickly. It is important to read the information as it clearly tells you that you arrive at an appointed time but you may have to wait for the procedure. the wait could be quite long so bring a book. On this occasion my wait from booking in to commencement of procedure was 1hr. I found all staff from reception to nursing to be polite, informative and caring. During the endoscopy there is a monitor so you can see what is going on and the assistants are really helpful to ensure you are comfortable and informed. My procedure lasted about 40 minutes. Afterwards, as I only used Entonox, I was quickly allowed to dress and move on to the final stage which is tea and a sandwich. This is a very busy department and there is some waiting time involved but if you are prepared for that it is a superb example of the NHS doing it right.",0
357079,"My daughter attended A&E on Tuesday 21.3.17 After taking an overdose of prescribed medication and being locked in a health centre car park for hours. She was reported as a missing person. So there was police involment. She was initially assessed by a very rude uncaring member of staff (her description) who actually laughed at her. Her husband and I arrived just after her initial assessment only to be told she had gone. The receptionist was quite unconcerned and didn't seem to understand our distress at being told that a very vulnerable, anxious person had been allowed to walk out of a hospital. After asking to see someone who could give us more information, we spoke to the nurse who dealt with my daughter initially. While they did what was required of them re. Reporting etc, their attitude regarding allowing a person who to all intents and purposes had tried to kill herself, was disgraceful. They told us that because my daughter knew her own name and knew what date it was, she was competent. They also stated that it was no longer their policy to stop someone who wanted to kill themselves from doing so. The police had to calleded a second time. This caused us further undue stress and anxiety as well as valuable police resources. My daughter was found an hour and half later trying to make her way home to Runcorn on foot. Needless to say she refused to go back to the A&E department",1
356915,"Each and every time I attend this hospital I have a good efficient experience, the staff are tremendous and professional in every way. In the past wait times have been quite long but that's to be expected in a walk in location. If it were not for this location then patients would have to travel to North Tees or Sunderland. Peterlee Community Hospital is therefore vital for health and well-being of local residents. The review options only allow for 1 specific visit to be selected, however, my experience has been the same regardless of department visited.",0
356919,"My wife was admitted 15th March to the Stroke Unit. I visited her on the 16th hoping to hear something on the 17th, and when I visited her with my son on the 18th nothing seemed untoward. At about 8.30pm on the 18th I received a phone call saying she had tried to get out of bed unsupervised and fallen on her face and was being taken for a scan. There was another phone call about 11pm saying her face was bruised but otherwise she was okay. I visited early Sunday morning. My wife was flat out and unconscious with serious bruising to her eyes, nose, head, arms, legs and breast. After about half and hour I was told she had had two strokes and there was pressure on the brain. Nothing could realistically be done to help her. I came away and my son and daughter visited about 5pm and were told the same. My wife dramatically regained consciousness 21st March when my son and daughter were visiting and she made progress until 24th when she was moved to Bedford Hospital.",1
357674,"Today I attended an educational information session for those of us preparing for immanent knee replacement surgery. The whole rationale is to make patients clear about the op, what to expect, how best to prepare and how to take an active part in the recovery process. As such it helps to make you an active participant in your care and much less anxious about the op. The 'school' complements an equally excellent and physically robust and well-produced spiral-bound booklet called 'Patient Guide for Knees', which can be read from front to back and absorbed in an hour or less, and then kept for reference as it has clear headings, a detailed contents section and very clear photographic illustrations, so you can access the particular info you need very quickly. The session today was relaxed, friendly, knowledgable and very informative, inviting our participation and questions.There was also the opportunity to have more personal questions answered - those that wouldn't have much relevance to others present. Those running the session were well organised, welcoming, professional and good-humoured, starting on time but also welcoming late comers. The information was laid out (as a PowerPoint presentation) in a sequence that enabled you to absorb the information and discover the answers to most of the questions you have, with opportunities to ask the remainder, and listen to other people's questions and answers. They also invited the comments of participants who had useful first-hand accounts of experience of knee ops they'd already had. In addition there were several actual examples of replacement knee joints to examine at our leisure, as well as models and clear diagrams. At the back of the booklet there is a list of useful telephone numbers which included a contact number for the person who had organised the session, in case extra questions arose. This feels like an invaluable safety net! The session lasted around an hour and a half: there is no way that this info could be delivered anywhere nearly as fully to patients individually or on the morning of the op (when if previously unprepared we'd be likely to be too anxious to take it in anyway). I think this is an example of extremely good practice, and as an individual I now feel better informed, cared for, personally involved in an active, not passive way, enabled to clarify more uncertainties if necessary and far more confident about the outcome of the op and how to manage my recovery.",0
357982,"I was given two separate appointments for a chest x-ray and vascular ultrasound. When I asked, the appointments were re-arranged for the same day and time which was brilliant. During my appointment, the x-ray staff were so friendly and welcoming and one staff member personally arranged for me to be fast tracked to the ultrasound room to ensure my visit was as efficient as possible. The staff member who performed the ultrasound was wonderful, so calm and reassuring. Overall it was a very positive experience. A caring and friendly attitude from staff does make all the difference - thank you!",0
357876,"I have now had various tests at Warwick Hospital. In general it appears well organised and efficient. One rarely has to wait long for the test or the results and the staff are invariably well informed, caring and helpful . Pre appointment literature is clear and always made available as is post-procedure literature.. Yesterday I had routine day surgery and a general anaesthetic. The pre appointment tests were quick and efficient. On the day itself patients were seen quickly by a range of kind and caring staff. I was rung this morning to check I was OK. I not really at liberty to comment on the quality of the clinical care, but in terms of process and admin I rate this hospital very highly and comment the CEO and COO for their work.",0
358193,"GP referral to Surgery department for examination. Arrival at A & E and long wait before moving to Walking Major depth. probably 2 hours. However staff in there efficient. First encounter with the doctor was very helpful and informative. This doctor would come and check up on me at various times, very good manner. On one occasion took the extra effort to change a catheter in my arm for my drip which was more for my comfort and convenience. Also an excellent professional nurse should receive special mention for their hard work and control over heavy work load late in the evening. These are only two who I particularly mention, but all the staff I came across front the person who cleans the rooms and makes wonderful Builders tea, to the staff in the CT scanning room. I will tell people tat this visit and my experience last year with Macmillan Cancercare unit last year have all been very professional and friendly. We feel very lucky to have Macclesfield hospital as our local one.",0
365172,"i was rushed to A&E september 2016, after spending 12 hours was told i had chest infection . It was a junior doctor whom diagnosed me. My son was appalled asked for 2nd opinion, was admitted to H3 with pneumonia. Next day was put on H4, the treatment by health care assistants was appalling. I was very ill but vaguley remembered the cruel, unproffesional staff. My condition deteriorated was then admitted to critical care, all staff were absolutely wonderful, the level of care was amazing, nothing was too much trouble. I spent 11 days on critical care although was traumatic & frightening i believe they saved my life. I was then back to H4, i was heartbroken, it was then i remembered how badly i was was treated before going on critical care. I remember being dragged up the bed by HCA, they were horrible to me, i was very sick but they ignored my condition & spoke over me. The manager on H4 is very caring, the doctors are great too I wanted to lodge a complaint about HCA;s on H4 but wouldnt do me any good. I just hope they don;t treat all really sick patients that way",1
360003,"My wife was taken into A&E last week. The paramedics who took her to the hospital were very professional and made sure she was well treated before they went. She was seen immediately at the hospital. Everyone from the student nurse and cleaners through to the Doctor who was in charge of her case acted professionally and took care to ensure my wife knew what was going on. After all tests were resolved my wife was discharged, knowing she had been fully checked out. I can only say we could not have received better treatment from beginning to end.",0
360105,"My father was admitted via A&E suffering from severe stomach pain. The paramedics that transported him were wonderful. He arrived in A&E and was assessed and treated promptly,by very polite and cheerful staff at all levels. He was then transferred to HDU where they began treatment to save his life. He had a gall stone and pancreatitis, which had caused sepsis. The staff were wonderful, kind,compassionate and incredibly accommodating with the family giving us clear and precise information regarding his condition. Following a procedure to remove the gall stone he was transferred to Ward 11 Male surgical ward where once again was treated with total respect and compassion as were we. I cannot fault the treatment my father received during his visit. However, the discharge process totally undid the good impression we had of the hospital. Having been told the day before he was being discharged the following day, he had to wait until 7pm to be discharged because they had to wait for the pharmacy to dispense his drugs. Incredibly frustrating to spend all day waiting for a phone call to come and collect him and did him no good at all as this distressed him greatly. Such a shame that after all the good work it was undone by poor organisation of the discharge process which the staff also find unacceptable. However, I am still very grateful for the care my father received.",0
360816,"I could not have asked for better antenatal care from the Electric Midwives Team. They supported me every step of the way with: - all the information and advice I could ever need, plus being available any time to answer questions - a warm, caring approach which always put me at ease - the chance to get to know the team and know that one of them (i.e. someone I knew) would be present at the birth - home visits (very convenient and so much less stressful than visiting hospital) - making time for me whenever I needed it",0
361125,"I attended the medical imaging department at a weekend for an MRI scan. The check in was very efficient with an automatic bar code scanner. Unfortunately the machine wasn't working and the time shown on the screen was not the same as the appointment. There was a hand written notice asking you to press the door bell if no one came to attend to you after 10 minutes. The facilities are all very modern with state of the art technology. It stated in the leaflet provided that you listen to music during the scan which I thought would help. Unfortunately, although I was wearing headphones, the radiographer forgot to switch on the radio until the last 5 minutes. It would have made the scan less unpleasant with the radio on.",0
361531,"A family member was admitted to Croydon university hospital some months ago. I must say the care she received from the day she arrived was just horrific. Being elderly and incontinent seemed to be a massive hindrance to the staff particularly on 'purley 1 ward.' Pain relief wasn't given on time- in fact the family member spent her two weeks in hospital in constant pain without sufficient drugs. Unfortunately family member passed away during stay on ward. Staff were rude, I compassionate and far from 'caring' ( a minimal requirement I would think to be a nurse.)",1
361763,"nobody really talked to us properly what was wrong with my mother in law, we were told no one could go with her to hospital in ambulance then she was dumped in A & E for 4 hrs on her own , then we were phoned by the hospital asking why she was there, but they rang the no we gave to the paramedics. she was discharged without her home being checked if it was suitable for her even tho she had 7 mini strokes, no advice was given on leaving. even tho they new she lived on her own",1
361994,"A relative was to be transferred to Newark hospital for a few days prior to being released with a care package in place. upon contacting the ward to enquire about visiting times my 76yr old mother in law was met by abuse and unhelpfulness. To be told that the patient should not be coming to them and as soon as he did he would be discharged as he would not be kept in just because he wasn't wanted at home is disgraceful. This patient has many health care needs including vascular dementia, type 2 diabetes, incontinence, heart failure, spinal and knee conditions. After being cared for at home by my mother in law for the last 10 years she is now on her knees unable to cope any more, after months of no sleep, not being able to leave him alone, carrying out personal care alone for a man twice her size she has eventually relented to needing some help. The senior nurse she spoke to had absolutely no idea of the history or condition of the patient, his notes etc had not yet been transferred, she had made a snap judgment and condemned my mother in law unjustly. I am appalled at the way she was treated. I arrived at her house a short time after the phone call to find her in floods of tears. Unforgivable!",1
362559,"Still an out patient. I had a trabeculectomy operation on 18/04/2017 . This was carried out by the Consultant, who in my opinion is a diamond. All the staff in the clinic were excellent under stressful situations . Going the extra mile for patients. A big thank you from myself. Also thanks for helping me sort out meds. A special thanks to the liason officer for their help. To all the staff in the Sanderson Suite in making my day for the operation as easy as possible . I will never forget the way in which each and every one of you made me feel comfortable thank you. Also thanks to the Anaesthetists. This government should come and see how dedicated you all are. Finally this is by far the best team in St Helens. Thanks to all of you",0
362832,"My husband went in for a Gastroscopy procedure. When he returned to the waiting area after the procedure he was not the healthy man that went in. His face was swollen, eyes were bloodshot and had suffered bruising to the eyes and surrounding area. I could not believe that this was the same person who had walked in not more than 30 minutes prior. Subsequently, he told me of his terrible experience where he could not stop gagging and convulsing due to the scope being passed down his throat. His gagging and convulsing did not abate and continued to do so for the entire procedure. I am at a loss for words as to why he was made to endure this awful experience? Additionally, why the Gastroscopy wasn't stopped and sedation offered? I understand that this is a very uncomfortable procedure, but to allow someone who was obviously extremely distressed is utterly unacceptable. Furthermore day two after his Gastroscopy, he has been suffering excruciating headaches, bloodshot eyes due to broken blood vessels and pain behind the eyes.",1
363709,My 94 year old mother was breathing rapidly and was unresponsive .We waited over 3 hours before anyone spoke to us. I had to ask what was happening. We all felt insignificant and because of her age and condition my mother was not a priority. A few kind words from someone would have made such a difference to a family in an extremely distressing situation. I had to ask for a pillow and was given a blanket to roll up because there were no pillows available. No effort was made to find one elsewhere. When my mother was eventually transferred to ward 15 the staff were very kind and caring. My mother died several hours later. We were relieved to move away from the emergency department because it was so impersonal and the staff basically ignored us. I have huge concerns for elderly patients having to attend this hospital on their own. So sad to receive such treatment at the end of the long life of a lovely human being who nursed children during the war.,1
363176,"I arrived apprehensively as you'd expect. From start to finish it was quick, professional and warm. The staff were informative yet they remained friendly and reassuring.

Awesome service, no waiting in between to make appointments with other departments. Truly a one stop shop.

363216,My mum was admitted to pembury with a broken hip. She had been fairly independent before that. I was shocked to realise fairly early on that for a frail elderly woman meals were plonked down in front of her which were unsuitable as she has very arthritic hands. She at times told me she was left too far away from water or food and then it would be removed having had little or nothing to eat. The bell response was very slow and I often had to go and fetch nurses who were around the main station to say she needed help going to the loo. Twice I arrived to find her alone on the toilet with the loo paper out of reach. It felt so sad to see that although high tech as a hospital the compassion and caring were severely lacking. There were some lovely staff but these were the exception. I almost lived in the ward to keep my mum safe and I would strongly advise all relatives to keep a close eye on their elderly relatives there.,1
363325,"From my experience of the Chelsea and Westminster in the last two years, the service that the hospital provides is excellent: •	The Dermatology dept run by the consultant and their team is first class; and •	they provide a “joined-up” service with gynaecology - working together closely so that you get the best possible treatment. I recently had day surgery: the waiting time was short; all the procedures were explained and the aftercare was excellent. The whole team were professional and caring and I felt very well looked after. I would therefore like to say a special “thank you” to the staff and team on the David Evans Ward.

How bizarre and unhelpful it is that the only way for a NON HEARING PERSON to make an appointment with the Audiology department is by using the telephone, for which a reasonable ability to hear is required. The Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust website says that it is possible to contact the Audiology department line number 01296 315725 by using text, so that would avoid the impracticalities of having to use a telephone, but that text service does not work.

I saw Elderly people left to be incontinent even though calling out to use facilities then left wet and soiled for hours, no I am not exaggerating. On one occasion a senior nurse gave medication for the man in the next bed to my Dad he was clearly in the later stages of dementia, he had thrown his cover off and had very obviously been doubly incontinent. They put the cover back over him and walked away three hours later at the time of shift handover five yes five HCA's came to assist him. What we witnessed made my blood boil, not one of them spoke to him they clearly and quite loudly had gone to him together to discuss an upcoming staff meeting. One staff member about five minuets in started shouting at the man that he wasn't helping and that he was hurting her back and that if he didn't help and stop trying to fight them they would leave him they then asked the others what he name was anyway. They carried on their unofficial staff meeting at the end of his bed. This was just one of the acts we witnessed while there. I regret greatly leaving my Dad on that ward I won't go into his treatment as I have made an official complaint but I will say I believe he would be alive today if I had taken him home.",1
366422,"My wife was admitted yesterday buy ambulance with a severely deformed leg she was in so much pain in fact the ambulance staff topped her up with morphine as they knew she wouldn't get any for a while, she was initially seen and sent for a xray thus then took over 4 hours before she was taken, after the xray she was then left over a hour n half before myself and my daughter asked the staff what was happening, we were approached by I presume head nurse who was arrogant and agresive in the way they spoke to us in fact because of their attitude I had to walk away and my daughter spoke to them and explained that if we had to wait much longer we would have to leave as I have to take regular medication to live they didn't care , I was always brought up that people went into nursing because they care not in fact the total oppersite, half hour later a doctor came to see my wife and said they were sending her for an xray we just laughed then asked them Wat planet they were on they'd allready had one they'd messed up but blamed it on someone else , finally after six hours we found out shed had broken both bones in her leg but still had not been given any pain relief by the hospital even though it was requested on several occasions. I'm a Barnsley lad and was proud of my town and it's hospital but not any more it's an embarrassment that they can leave someone in pain for all those hours",1
366515,I was referred to Bolton One by my GP for a chest X-Ray. I had never used this Centre before and was only vaguely aware of its existence. Parking in the close NCP was easy. The X-Ray department was clearly signposted. I was logged in at reception and sat in the small Waiting Area. Within 10 minutes I was called in by a very friendly person. The X-Ray took 5 minutes and I was told my GP would have the results within 3 working days. A very pleasant experience.,0
366631,"I'm so sad as a mum of a 29 year old daughter who has suffered with cyclic vomiting syndrome since early childhood, and has severe retching and unusual behaviours when so sick and dehydrated. My daughter is seeing a neurologist very soon she is under a gastric doctor who knows all of my daughters illness and behaviours. She often only in episode has to come hospital and receive IV fluids canular meds, and go home and battle through it. On most occasions staff are helpfully in a busy environment. This week my daughter had two visits for meds IV fluids, and Saturday 6..5.17 My daughter had to go back to A..E.. with her dad. on arrival with her dad at hospital they gace her care plan to a member of staff who saw my daughter looking weak, agitated and not aware of her surroundings when in episode. This member of staff was refusing at first her IV fluids saying has she took drugs as my daughter was very vulnerable in episode. This member of staff quickly took her dad off on his on to question him, which left my daughter scared on her on in cubicle we never can leave her alone in this state. My daughter went searching calling dad and she was ignored. Mean while her dad asked lots questions of my daughters appearance as the nurse asked if she was addicted to IV drips and said she looked like she had been drug taking. How dare the nurse assume things we go through. We look after our daughter in episode she looks mentally ill but it's just how the episode affects her. She had low pottasiom too and to. Assume the nurse said on drugs wow. How debilitating for my hard working daughter who. Works for council and runs a home. Carers for her daughter exceptionally well .Only in these episodes she can't care for her self. . .These behaviours. Are linked to brain function and migraine related and testing soon for epilepsy ' so how dare the nurse treat her and her father this way .Eventually. Given IV fluids. Injections and low pottasiom through IV my daughter. After episode. Goes bk to. Work full time runs a good home ect. I will be putting in complaint. Never assume or judge. A person by there appearance especially in times of. Severe illness",1

After being totally shocked and still to this day baffled after finding what I can only described as 70% blood as I had a pee - saved sample for doctor who referred me to Urology . Urology accused me of having cancer phobia because I found blood .... they examined me 'down there' and conversation I said I went straight to doctors because some years ago my wife died of cancer - the Urology doctor sent a letter weeks to my 'Own doctor' weeks later accusing me of having a cancer phobia after the test proved I was ok. We never found out what caused the bleed - but this doctor should be retrained, I dont have a cancer phobia ...... I have cancer awareness - total lack of respect.",0
367108,1. Having experienced some months in hospital I have heard day after day (4-10 times) the nurses first say that they will have to move me back up the bed and also the mattress. I think a huge amount of money could be saved by a quite cheap arrangement by cutting the high number of nurses having damaged backs - then having time off or having to finish nursing: Hooks could go around the bar at the end of the bed to prevent mattress and therefore patient sliding down bed. 2. Similar set up using webbing sides to mattress and cords and hooks (for bar) to attach to top bar of bed frame,0
367207,"Had my 3rd visit/procedure at Preston & must say how thrilled I am with the excellent service I've received. I travel 1hr out of area for treatment here due to NHS mistrust issues locally. From the warm welcome at Reception (& handy directions as 2 areas for this service - a long distance apart!) to the lovely greeting within both Depts - you're greeted like a long lost friend. All staff remain totally professional, kind, compassionate & friendly. They never forget they're dealing with people who are in chronic pain (with all that brings) and are experts at putting ""very sore & anxious patients"" at ease, who may be about to undergo very uncomfortable procedures. The kettle is always on ""post procedure"" - a lovely touch! Parking (esp for blue badge holders) can sometimes mean a queue. I've never queued for longer than 20min even at peak times (i.e. 1:15 visiting time & start of afternoon clinics). However, people are coming/going all time. Just allow plenty of time for parking & it's free for blue badge holders. Great coffee, food & shopping opportunities if you're early with ample seating.",0

Some nurses just barging into the room without knocking , Nurses gossiping about night life whilst taking my wife's blood pressure and not concentrating. Intimidating body language when talking to me about my wife ( Both hands on hips ). We begged them to take the catheter needle out of my wife's hand as she was in terrible pain. They did eventually apologise for forgetting her.There were a few kind nurses who treated us with respect . We left feeling that we were a nuisance to them.We chose this hospital because people told us that it was one of the best in the country",1
367575,My daughter who suffers from severe complex mental health problems recently attended A&E after harming herself. The initial doctor in A&E came across as very aggressive and uneducated with regards to mental health issues. The Doctor demanded my daughter remove her upper clothing (which was completely unnecessary) so they could take a blood test. They tapped my daughter's hand to bring the veins up in an aggressive forceful manner. The Doctor asked my daughter intrusive judgemental questions and when my daughter didn't answer they continued to question her. Apart from this one particular doctor I found all the other staff we encountered very caring and understanding and they did their best to make my daughter feel calm and comfortable.,0

I'm really upset and they put me down. My baby an I had to stay in hospital for five days for both of us to be on I.v anti biotics. There theatre staff were saying how infected my placenta was and how I had no waters left. I then got told by husband that they nearly had to take my womb out cause was so infected and couldn't stop the bleeding, but luckily the bleeding slowed down after 4 hours in recovery. It's such a traumatic experience. I did have some lovely midwife's after there was a couple that was really horrible to me because of my scars on my arms :(",1
368049,Last week my mother became unwell with symptoms of a stroke. My family unfortunately were wrongly advised and ended up transporting my mum to A&E rather than use 999 service. When I arrived at the hospital I could see that things were not right and being a nurse spoke to the triage nurse. This triage nurse was dismissive and rude and failed to listen saying that mum was FAST negative. I pushed for help and eventually help came but very grudgingly. Long story short my mum had had a mini stroke - triage nurses need to listen and not ignore family,1
368220,"I just want to shout out a loud thank you to all the staff I met at KGH last week. EVERY single person was cheerful, helpful, caring, respectful and professional and gave me the care I needed as efficiently and with as much support and dignity as possible. Yes, it WAS VERY BUSY everywhere. But I was kept informed and when I needed urgent pain relief in A&E they sorted it straight away. I know resources are stretched but the front line staff could not be doing more than they do, to earn our praise and respect. This is a special hats off to the A&E team wednesday 10th May day and night staff, both the X-Ray and CT scan staff that night, Deene A team (naturally this includes all the truly wonderful HCAs) both shifts and the Geddington ward team (ditto) - Thursday 11-Saturday 13th (thank you for listening to me and for the extra bladder scan at 2am! And thank you for all your patience and understanding), and including the porter, who made me giggle just when I needed to! - and of course all the theatre staff and surgeons.

368244,I visited ward 24 last night as my mother was to be transferred to a respiratory ward and was told this was one. Went on this ward to find an elderly woman crawling on the floor on her hands and needs she said it was because the staff wouldn't help her. I brought it to the staffs attention who walked to the elderly lady and in an unfriendly manner told her to get up off the floor unaided the elderly lady replied she couldn't without help so the nurse gave her a begrudge hand. I was very upset and angry as not only was I lied to that this was a respiratory ward but that they could even contemplate putting my mother who is severely ill on such an uncaring ward.,1
368266,Referred to hospital by gp for serious infection. Admitted quickly once eventually parked and found ward . Three hrs later husband declining needed rehydration in extreme pain and getting delirious. Nurses unable to provide any palliative care until junior doctor arrived. Even though husband kept saying talk to me they ignored me even though I had all the history. Despite the fact he has severe chest infection he has been referred to urology consultant who will not talk to me and is proposing life changing and debilitating surgery that affects both our lives. Staff on 107 never answer phone. I am concerned that he is not being given treatment for correct thing but unable to talk to anyone. He's now on oxygen and seems to be getting worse not better. So hospital needs to improve its communication with carers who are there to share facts not be a nuisance.,1
373758,"There is no clear information about where exactly is out of hour GP services (via 111) are located at Northwick Park Hospital. No signposts what so ever. Advisor from 111 were not sure of the location either. Most people are thinking Urgent Care is for out of service GP appointments via 111. It happened to us today. Thankfully, the desk receptionist for hour GP services called us while we were waiting in a queue at Urgent Care /A&E building to report to main reception of the hospital. I think the existing location needs to be highlighted clearly on websites (hospital, GP) and also should be sign posted for visiting drivers. There no information about this on our GP (Kenton Bridge Medical Centre) 's website. They have highlighted Edgware walk-in center instead.",0

Dinner: roast chicken ( no skin) with mashed potato ( no vegetables) Dessert: chocolate sponge pudding with custard If there were several choices under each heading I think it would be easier for those that might not have imagination where food is concerned.",0

My mother and I came to the hospital to see his body. We were horrified to that they kept his body in the same room with other patients. We were not allowed to grieve privately. At one point did any of the nurses try to explain what happened. They didn't bother with us. The doctor knew we were coming never turned up. In the end me and my mum had left.

The staff fantastic, he was seen immediately and without even being assessed, straight away they said ""croup"" They concerned as his temperature was not decreasing despite medication. There was a few staff members around his bed, providing prompt attention. They advised his airway was restricted hence he was having episodes at home, Both myself and my husband witnesses the staff discussing the case and appalled he was turned away twice at Halton. I could not thank the staff enough at Warrington. My son's health is paramount. I cannot believe that my concern for his welfare was misinterpreted for being an overly anxious mother.

Your professionalism and (Grimsby style) sense of humour, is second to none (in my eyes anyway). Thank you one & all, Mark ?? (MARK JORGENSEN)",0
378584,"I was referred for a genealogical exam which I attended on Monday 26 June 2017. The consultant was extremely professional asking relevant questions, explaining the entire process and involved me when undertaking an ultrasound scan. The consultant undertook a thorough and comprehensive examination. There was a nurse present throughout and I was really satisfied. To my surprise, I received a copy of the consultant's letter to my GP in record time on Wednesday 28 June 2017 with their diagnosis and recommendations. This is honestly the best service I have received as an outpatient in the UK and most times I am satisfied with the service received. Thank you. Hopefully you have students and they follow your example. Sheril St Rose",0
378849,"My dad recently was admitted to the northern general the he was put on the chesterman ward he is 98.The attitude of some ofthe staff towards older people is disgraceful .A certain auxiliary shouted in dads face when he was resting and made him jump, they also used their authority in a unfriendly manner to give patients instructions.Older people need to be treat with respect they are at a very vulnerable stage of their lives.Dad was fortunate enough to come home with my support but he was left traumatised by his stay I was glad he had my support as I feel so sorry for elderly patients that don't. I think staff need to treat older people with the dignity they deserve.My mum also had an awful time in the Vickers part of the hospital after having broke her hipl that was the worst place I have ever had to witness in my life it was horrendous mum was 93 she was brought a large meal of stew which looked awful who would think of giving elderly people such a meal she nearly choked worrying she must eat it.The care staff that worked there had no idea how to look after the elderly I don't know what training they are given probably a two day course they had no idea a young carer with a bowl of water got a flannel and wet mum through before I could stop her mum was frightened as she had a fear of water anyway.Also this carer said in front of mum is she blind it hurt me very much .The ward was absolutely chaotic mum asked for help to go to the toilet no one came hence it was to late .We asked to take mum home which we did and gave her the dignity she deserved unfortunately she had to go back into hospital we choose The Royal Hospital Chesterfield.This hospital put our faith back in hospitals they looked after mum so well caring kind and compassionate unfortunately mum passed away in the hospital but we had peace of mind how well she had been looked after.There is a great need for improvement at your hospital in many areas of nursing the elderly.",1
379245,"This practices has over 14000 patients. Higher than average number of which are in full time work who balance family, work and financial commitments. However, the practice is not equipped to meet the health needs of these patients. The practice is open from 9am to 5pm with no offer of extended hours or out of hours appointments. While this might be available (who knows?) it is not offered to patients. Myself and other patients with small children find impossible to get timely medical advice at this practice, we go directly to walking centre or A&E. GP practice management is not interested in listening to patients views. I have applied to join practice patients group but did not hear anything back for over a month. Bottom line, GPs are generally good but if you can not get appointment, what's the point?",0
379857,"As an outpatient attending a walk-in-service for x-rays in radiology I was very impressed with the care and service I received. The reception staff were welcoming and I was seen within 20 minutes by the most kind and friendly members of the radiology team, I was not expecting to be see so quickly at all!!! I am sure the waiting times vary depending on the day of the week and time of day but I am so grateful that we have the NHS, and for those that work really hard to ensure the best care for patients. I have never had a bad experience at Kings - 5* out of 5* from me :)",0
380035,"Outstanding level of care given from admittance through to discharge. Staff were efficient, friendly and encouraging. Communication was excellent. The surgeon was first-class - reassuring, considerate and most importantly fantastic at their job. The procedure was carried out as explained and went to plan. The surgeon and Cath Lab team were entirely professional with an obvious good rapport between the different levels of staff. All of my expectations were exceeded in every area and I would highly recommend this department to anyone who may need treatment of this nature. Well done to the whole team. I cannot thank you enough.",0
380071,"I visit an orthopaedic clinic regularly and am a blue badge holder. I think it is wrong for charges to be levied to badge holders. What I now find is a major problem is the fact that your meters will not accept the new £1 coins, even though they have been in circulation for over 3 months. Banks only issue the new coins and less and less are in change from shops. I have spoken to your car park office who say that there is a note on meters advising that a stock of old coins is available from their office. They also say that the machines are not due to be updated to accept the new coins until sometime in September. Blue badges are issued to people who have difficulties walking long distances and the distance to the car park office, especially from the Hartshead blue badge car park is much too long a walk to seek change. If your machines will not accept the new legal tender coins the I consider that you should allow free parking to valid badge holders until such time as your machines are updated",0
380719,"My mother spent her last two weeks in this hospital , at first in Victoria ward where the staff were very caring and a great comfort . She spent four days in this ward and we had no issues. The doctor was caring and gave time willingly. Unfortunately she was discharged but had to be readmitted a couple of days later. Her condition deteriorated quite rapidly . She was placed in Okan ward. Again the doctor was excellent and very understanding and showed real empathy in explaining the inevitable end . She was transferred to Mary ward where she spent her last few days . Again the nursing staff were excellent and the young doctor I spoke with had a very nice approach and again showed great empathy.",1
381027,Spent nearly 6hrs in MK A&E. Triage nurse was rude and snappy and when man collapsed in waiting room it was myself and another waiting relative who initially had to deal with him before staff reluctantly helped. Not enough staff on - man who got back from his xray just as we arrived only got a plaster on just before we were seen 6 hrs later. Only 8 minors patients in that 6 hours so struggling to see why it was so slow. Only positives were the lovely radiographer and doctor we saw when we eventually got seen. Would avoid attending here as poorly organised.,0
380844,"I cannot fault the service provided by the Dermatology cancer screening unit and minor ops clinic. I was referred to this hospital by my GP and from the outset I can only praise the staff, facilities and efficiency of the unit involved. The communications via telephone and in writing were clear and informative The facilities at the hospital were excellent, including good public transport links and parking facilities The hospital environment is pleasant and provides a sense of well being and confidence The staff at the clinic were friendly, helpful and efficient and a credit to the NHS The follow up information service has been excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this hospital",0

The problem was everyone was so indisisive they couldn't decide whether to send him to the trauma hospital at Middlesbrough or take him into theatre for a scan and all this time he was unconscious and being worked on , I screamed for them to take him to the other hospital which they eventually did .i was in shock I felt physically sick and my mouth was so dry I couldn't speak I asked 4 staff members for water and they said they didn't have any I was nearly fainting !! So I didn't get a drink until we got to the other hospital, I can't believe a hospital has no drinking stations .the good news is my grandson survived and is back to normal but I feel we could have lost him or he could have had brain damage because of the delay . The treatment at James cook was fantastic",1
380996,"I have recently visited the hospital again with my father and heard him praise again the work of the doctor. 10years ago he was treated by the doctor for the removal of his bladder, kidney and prostate. The doctor was such a lovely person throughout the whole experience -from before the operation to the day my father was admitted into intensive care as he had had complications. The doctor came back from time off to come and see my father and apologise that they were not able to reconstruct my fathers bladder... but said i could not risk your life.. Till this day my father speaks of the doctor with nothing but praise.. and holds a great amount of respect in his heart for them.. The care in Hopkins ward after the operation was outstanding...",0
381037,"My friend is 68 and became ill 7 months ago, her GP kept saying she was fine and giving her pain killers. She had huge gaping mouth ulcers, was bleeding from her back passage and we took her to A&E 3 mnths ago. They said she was under the care of her GP, couldn't do anything and sent her away with pain meds. Long story short, we were forced to take her to a private Dr who has diagnosed Chrones. She has lost 7 stone and is bleeding from her back passage. She was rushed into A&E and needed 5 pints of plasma. A fissure was cleaned up and two days later, she was sent home. 2 days after, she bled so heavily all over her house we had to call an ambulance again. She's back in, has waited over 24 hrs for plasma, endoscopy results not back in 3 days, no high cal drinks have been given as promised. No one has decided what to do, she is not being treated as a priority. She had another severe bleed in hospital last night, still nothing is planned to find out why this keeps happening or to stop it? I spoke to the ward sister, who knows nothing. I am seriously concerned that this lady may fade away waiting for any treatment that will help at this hospital. I have complained but the apathy is unbelievable and we are getting no where and no answers. We are seriously tempted to take her out of this hospital as sick as she is and try taking her to another better hospital elsewhere.",1

382456,"We have visited Neurology frequently over a 3 year period for Epilepsy treatment following brain tumour surgery. The staff at all levels and disciplines (nurses, administrators, consultants) have been consistently professional and competent, frequently going above and beyond to assist - sorting our additional appoinments, seeing us in lunch hours, etc. The appointments have never felt rushed and the detailed explanations have helped considerably to provide reassurance about current and potential future treatment options. The expert, state of the art facilities on which the department can call - both within the Hallamshire and beyond - have been another source of reassurance.",0
382953,"My 85 year old mum had an elective total hip replacement at the beginning of May. The operation was a success and the majority of staff on Great Tey ward were caring and patient. Unfortunately a week after being discharged, mum was readmitted to hospital, firstly to A&E, where the staff were good, keeping mum and me informed. However, she was then transferred to the Medical Day Unit/Emergency Assessment Unit where she was seen by 2 other doctors who said she didn't have a chest infection (which A&E doctor had diagnosed). As she had an upset stomach she was placed in a side room in isolation. During the next 2 days the staff concentrated on treating the infection and seemed to forget she had recently had a hip replacement. She was left sitting in a chair that was too low (an OT requested that it be replaced but this never happened). Mum told me when I visited that she had felt her hip click when getting up from chair. She was discharged after 4 days but then admitted again 4 days later as still had an infection. She was again put in isolation in EAU then moved to a side room on D'Arcy ward. Although staff were nice they again seemed to be forgetting hip replacement. Chair was too low again and she was being transferred from wrong side of bed. These matters were addressed but only after her new hip had dislocated and she had to return to theatre for manipulation. When she came out of isolation, she was visited by a physio and an OT whilst I was with her. They told us she had just been referred to them but referral had stated hip was replaced in January instead of May. After moving to Kate Grant ward at Clacton Hospital for rehabilitation she was then taken ill again and brought back to Colchester. She again ended up in same side room in isolation on D'Arcy ward. Staff were on the whole good with mum despite being short staffed at times and she was upset to leave some of them. However, when we got her home last Friday, I discovered whilst reading discharge notes that mum had a grade 3 heel sore which neither mum or I knew about, I was at hospital every day so staff had opportunity to mention this. Heel sore was an open wound and mum was discharged with it uncovered which her family were very angry about. Her long term medication had also been stopped with no explanation as to why. I phoned the ward and spoke to doctor on duty who told me they felt she didn't need it. Mum has lower lumbar spinal stenosis and was put on this medication for nerve pain and because her lower leg often became completely numb causing her to fall. Whilst we appreciate Government cuts have put a strain on medical staff, mum's rehabilitation is taking a lot longer than the original time stated for replacement hips, which we feel has been due to a lack of communication.",1
383036,"Over the past few months, I have had cataract surgery on both eyes and, this week, saw the consultant who confirmed that both were successful and healing as expected. From the beginning to the completion of this process, I have experienced top class service from every member of the Eye Clinic Team. This covers the operating surgeons, nurses and support professionals in the Treatment Centre and the staff involved with monitoring and checking in the main hospital and the Victoria Infirmary Northwich Whilst it is not acceptable here to give names, I was, over the period, attended to by different people with different roles. The high quality of skill and commitment was consistent on every visit to the hospitals. Many thanks to you all at the Eye Care Centre. I am happy for this review to be used as you think fit to reassure current and potential patients about the quality of the Centre and its team. I particularly hope it is able to be seen by the staff as well-deserved feedback.",0
383788,"I visited A&E today with my young son aged 11. He had sustained a nasty head injury after a fall. The nurses were absolutely amazing. They put him at ease and helped keep him calm, especially as he ended up needing plastic surgery to stitch up his forehead. They made a worrying situation more bearable and kept my son distracted during the injections and stitching. I really am so grateful to them both. Their humour coupled with their excellent bedside manner got my son through a very scary time. Thankyou so much for your wonderful care of my son Mathew. Xx",0
383839,I went in for a planned procedure and was very impressed by the whole cardiothoracic department. The entire staff team was friendly and very professional. I thought the quality of care was fabulous. The food was delicious too. I wasn't thrilled to be in a mixed-sex high dependency unit but was quickly moved to a single en-suite room. They don't have the facilities for single-sex high dependency care. I would recommend James Cook to anyone. I have nothing but praise for the quality of care.,0
383877,I am very impressed with the service within this department. The nurses are always friendly and professional. They explain everything and answer all of my questions clearly with a reassuring approach. They are flexible and responsive to my needs. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen. My doctor is very professional and skilled and is 'not happy unless I am happy'. This is a fantastic department. They tailor their approach to the individual and I could not ask for more. Thank you so much!,0

She was subsequently readmitted in June to have an infection treated, before passing away peacefully in a care home in July. On both these occasions, and on others in the past, my godmother commented on the excellent NHS care she received at Warwick, and she asked me before she died to express thanks on her behalf to all those involved in her care. My grateful thanks therefore to all the staff at Warwick who have looked after my godmother over the years, and in particular for the dignity, respect and compassion she was shown during her final days.",0
384257,"We recently attended the parenting class hosted by the Tulip Team at North Mid and must say that we were highly satisfied. Session 1 was focused on birth and session 2 on how to look after the baby. Both session were very informative, based on scientific data and very practical. It was particularly insightful when it comes to know the specific ways of this hospital versus other hospitals. The tour of the birthing suites and the labour ward were excellent. The hosting midwifes were very welcoming, I highly recommend doing the course if you are expecting a baby. Thanks again - please pass on the high praise!",0
384397,Absolutely appalling my husband and son were in a car accident it took 45mins for an ambulance to arrive whilst my son was bleeding & further 15mins for another to arrive. The nurses were absolutely usless made them wait for hours in the waiting room whilst bleeding & in pain wouldnt even give my 14 year old son pain killers i had to have a go at the nurses so they would give my son paracetamol. Eventually didnt even bother to do relevent tests (xrays) or clean the dried blood from his injurys was sent home still bleeding from his facial injuries very disappointed with the service considering they rob us of our hard earned cash (tax) and the level of service given was very unsatisfactory,1
384527,I was referred for Rheumatology opinion by my GP 20/4/17. I had an appointment for 3/7/17 which I unavoidably needed to cancel ( booked holiday). I quickly tried to rearrange another appointment but nothing was available via choose and book until August ( no fun when you are in pain and having repeated steroid medications with their lovely side effects!!!). 13/6/17 Appointment was sent to me for Aug 18th @ 9am. Plans made with work to attend this 23/6/17 Further letter received informing me that this appointment has been cancelled and 'we will contact you in the near future to arrange another date and time'!!! I called number on letter to be informed that I may have 11 week further wait!!!!! 12/7/17 - Back to GP pretty miserable with multiple joint pains. Further steroid course with awful side effects this time. GP expedited my referral 27/7/17 Attempted to contact service to get some idea of when appointment may be because I have 3 day training for a new job which I cannot miss and I want to book a holiday in September ( Patients do have a life!!!) . Guess what..... Automated phone receiving service. So; still haven't a clue!!! Friends and Family Test - would I recommend this service. What do you think?,0
384747,"Attended A and E after GP sent me suspecting absess and infection. After spending the 4 hours waiting, I was admitted to a ward. I was sent to the wrong ward originally. Got sent to correct Ward and was left for hours without water or being told what to do. Eventually just got into bed without any treatment at midnight which was 8 hours after arriving. Nurses were abrupt and the next day they were rude. Finally got seen to at midnight and given antibiotics. Infection turned into absess and even with this the doctor said go home. Upon discharge, the absess that apparently wasn't an absess exploded all over the bed and auxiliary nurse helped but nurse was awful. Doctor came round and said they've made a mistake but only after leaving me in tears for further few hours. Still sent home and brought back for surgery. The surgery wasn't done properly and have complained. Apologies made but I ended up going to Freemans to have it done properly. Was very upsetting.",1
386470,"Rushed my mother to A&E for constant committing and severe lower back pain. She was screaming and kept screaming for hours till i ask someone to get her painkillers. She was admitted into the day centre after 5 hours and diagnosed with kidney stone the nurses were very efficient . The doctors said that they would do a procedure to remove the stone. She was told to fast the night before only to be rudely told by a doctor she had never seen before that she was being discharged the next morning, no explanations. She was still in pain. I brought her home only to realise that they didn't even give her pain relief. Rushed her back, after a few hours she was seen by a doctor who explained every thing to us. She told us that the kidney stone had moved on it's own and was almost in the bladder and that was why the procedure was cancelled. She have us pain relief and anti-sickness to take home. I am so grateful to this doctor. No other doctor had explained anything to us. They spoke to us like we were imbeciles.",1
387293,"Having attended ward 20 this morning, I must register my appreciation and thanks to the whole medical team who supported and treated me. From start (including my pre-admission visit) to dischage from the ward, I encountered nothing but excellence. Each member of the team played their part. One particular member of staff is truly a superb asset, but mentioning them neglects others who played such an important and helpful role. I give my thanks to all. For other patients (or potential patients) reading this revew, it would be helpful to mention the following matters: 1. The most challenging part of this intervention is preparation with Klean Prep: chill it, add concentrated lime juice and drink at least 3 litres fast using three straws. 2. Procedure on the day with sedation is painless and not in any way distressing. 3. Do not worry - anticipation is worse than the reality. Thanks again.",0
387711,"My 21 year old son suddenly became unwell and drifted into unconsciousness ... the paramedic car and ambulance arrived quickly and identified he was having some kind of stroke, he had all the signs, facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulties. They got him to hospital quickly and when we got to COCH, we were met by the A&E & Stroke Unit teams who worked seamlessly with the Radiology department to diagnose a stroke caused by an incredibly rare Vertebral Artery Dissection. Its a flap-like tear in the inner lining of the vertebral artery, which is located in the neck and supplies blood to the brain. They were within the 4.5 hour window to give him thrombolysis. Fortunately, his speech came back, slowly the movement of his head and arms came back (he had been paralysed from the neck down). There are no words to express how incredibly grateful we are to them all.",0
387844,"I, along with many other patients and relatives, was so shocked at the shambles in admission to the ambulance/emergency department yesterday evening. Patients were lining the corridors, paramedics were doing obs. Nurses who were doing obs were writing on odd scraps of paper or on the backs of their hands, there seemed to be no order or organisation. One man discharged his poor wife after waiting for 6 and a half hours, to try and find care elsewhere. Another man sat in quiet agony with a dislocated shoulder and bleeding head for even longer. Luckily the paramedics had given my husband morphine as he was in so much pain - we waited nearly 5 hrs before seeing a doctor. When paramedics put it call to transfer my husband to hospital I heard them request The Alex in Redditch or Worcester but they were told to go to Russell's Hall - why if they were so busy and why did it all feel so hit and miss. Terrible experience.",0

388314,My appointment with Mr Ahmad (ENT) happened bang on time. I saw him for an initial examination then he sent me for a hearing test - just a few minutes wait. Back to Mr Ahmed 10 minutes later for the results. He then sent me for a blood test - just another 10 minutes wait. I walked out of of Good Hope Hospital just one hour after my appointment - amazingly efficient. Mr Ahmad referred me for a CT scan.

However, if you are going to charge £3.20 for what turned out to be 25 minutes parking you could at least maintain the pay machines. It took me longer to pay for parking than it did to complete the appointment! - very poor. Machine in car park would not accept notes; nearest machine in main building had no change so had to walk a good distance to find a machine that was actually working properly.

388742,"Southend hospital provides an extremely strong line of business with chemotherapy. Outstanding staff at all levels have provided an exceptional service to help us hold the strength required for us to get through chemotherapy. Strong management have created a great LOB. Management team at chemotherapy are strong leaders that do a great role involving patients as well as all levels of staff within their business. Chemotherapy team leads also provide strong management and support the new staff by providing strong leadership in a diverse department. Team leads undoubtedly inspire new members of staff and appear to have created a great place to work as well as a relaxing place to ensure that those having chemotherapy can relax as required. I personally have been provided every relevant service including: - Help obtain comfort for us fighting cancer in our own ways. - Created a positivity as appropriate. - Provide great service to the partners of those of us using chemo. My wife is well looked after and appropriate data/requirements from all staff at Chemotherapy. Management teams clearly understand the requirements of patients as much as their knowledge of their own business. The service provided here has given me a good experience throughout my chemotherapy. My only mild issue is that I am not a believer in separating male from female. I do understand your thoughts, but I do believe that some of us feel more comfortable in a unisex environment rather than a male or female battle environment.

389027,"On the 11/09/17 I had taken my son to be observed at St. Peter's hospital, he was there from 8:30 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening where he was supposed to be watched the whole time he was there, the nurse that was supposed to be observing him kept going out of the room and only saw him for about 15 minutes max throughout the whole time he was there. My son was there because he falls over for no reason like his legs give way in him, the observation was to find out why he keeps falling but the nurse was never there when he fell, the one time the nurse had seen him fall he whacked his head on the desk at the nurses station in front of about 4 nurses and none of the nurses came to see if he was ok. I took him back to his bed where he was still screaming so much that he couldn't catch his breathe and was going blue in the face, the whole time his nurse was just standing beside us watching and all they did was ask my mum if she wanted coffee and did not help my baby when he was screaming then they walked away, I eventually got my son to calm down and stop crying then his nurse came back over and told me that his fall was normal because of his hight??? He now has a bruise on his head. Then he had to have blood tests which they had put numbing cream on him in 4 different places but the ones on his hands hadn't stuck properly and the cream came off, they took blood from his hand which wasn't numb as the cream didn't stay on so he screamed and by the time they had finished his hand was covered in blood where it kept dripping out and has now got a bruised hand which is still hurting him. He then was walking around the room he was in and the nurse was not there he again had fallen over and he whacked his head on the bed he was walking next to, he screamed but no nurses came into the room to see what was wronge with him and has yet another bruise on his head, after this fall he had fallen asleep and normally his naps are only an hour or less but he had slept for 3 hours which I found really unusual as he never sleeps that long but the nurse told me that it was normal. I am totally unsatisfied with my sons experience at this hospital as he came out with more bruised than he went in with and he still didn't get a diagnosis as they said there is nothing wrong with him when there clearly is he can't just be falling down for no reason.",1

389139,My wife is 40. In Nov 2015 she started to suffer regular headaches marked with speech loss and loss of balance. In Feb 2016 she was rushed into a&e with symptoms of stroke or worse; they tested for brain stem cancer and stroke but found nothing so suggested vestibular migraine. Since then she has felt repeatedly fobbed off with pills and 'come back in three months' despite her debilitation getting worse and worse. She is now unable to walk for more than 100m without having an episode and had to give up her pgce because she failed a h&s risk assessment for the travel. She has collapsed and hit her head causing a concussion. We moved house because the old house wasn't safe. She has spent 40 of the last 48 hours asleep - a regular occurrence. I am desperate to get her properly examined especially now that her inability to exercise or eat properly has brought on diabetes.,1
389128,My mother had a colonoscopy procedure done at homerton recently and she said she's never ever experienced pain like the pain she felt during the procedure.. She was given no sedation and she felt every part of her being checked about. She said the pain was so excruciating that she felt like she was going to die. Unfortunately i was not there during the time but I'm sure as hell going to want explanation of why no sedation was offered and why she had to be awake the whole way through the process. I cannot believe no sedation was offered to an almost 80 year old woman. I'm disgusted.,1

Mum said this happened sevral times through the night as well, although mum said her own needs were listened to following surgery and surgery its self went well she witnessed other patients being treated as if they were just a nuisance and not taken seriously when they were clearly in lot of discomfort, distress and in need of help. she was discharged two days after surgery and though she said she felt she still needed medical attention felt much safer going home",0
390214,"My wife was admitted through A and E bleeding from the mouth and rear, admitted to ward 46 all fine, then admitted to ward 49 my wife has cancer is confused and hallucinates, Dr never spoke to me ,her husband just my wife, my wife was treated with units of blood plus fluids, bleeding stops , she went for a camera down, but it was aborted as her teeth where bleeding, Dr spoke to my wife to find out if she could cope at home, she said she was fine. Still nobody asked me how she could cope, the communication on the ward was just terrible, I have been in a lot of hospitals, but for communication this is the worst I have had the misfortune to attend. My wife was sent home with no care plan, when asked about the bleeding, was told to go to a dentist, our dentist won't touch her teeth. Also told by the sister on ward 49 that you live in Wales and glan clwyd hospital is very good .",1

392119,"I was referred to the pain clinic for treatment. It is ongoing, at point of writing 2015-2017, as the origins of the pain haven't disappeared, but I'm assured of treatment when I need it. The extensive therapy group is life changing. If you're selected to go on it, or if it's offered, take the opportunity. It's a brilliant course, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Treatment options are discussed with pain specialists, as well as the causes. Consultations are quite long, so there's time for you to explore your health, concerns, and treatment, with your consultant.",0

We recommend that you arrive by 4pm (by 5.45pm for our late Wednesday evening clinic at the Princess Royal) because they become very busy. If you arrive later and the clinic is full, we cannot guarantee that you will have your blood test. The clinics must finish on time so samples can be sent to our laboratories."" The clinic was observed to close to clients at 3.45pm - a notice was placed upon the ticket machine to that effect. People arrived from work after that time but before 4pm and were rejected as a result of that notice. Please check your CCTV to confirm the action. Surely appointments can be made to accommodate for those who work and pay taxes for the NHS England and ensure a smooth flow of clients through the system. There is no privacy in the room where blood is taken.",0
392809,I attended the dermatology clinic and used the self check in facility. I then put the 2nd page of my letter containing the bar code in the appropriate box. After sitting there at least .5 hours after my time slot I looked at page 1 of my letter and could not see my consultants name on the white board behind the desk so went to the desk. I asked why and got no reply and also asked if the Dr. was running late and was told in fact they were on time. When I mentioned that my bar code (2nd page of the letter) had been put in the box some time ago I was told they don't even know you are here because you didn't put the 1st page in the box. I ask why didn't a member of staff comment and request page 1 of my letter when they found only page 2 instead of me sitting there more than .5 hours after my allotted appointment time. May I suggest that your staff at the check in desk need to have more training in regards to patient care.,0

I was directed to the ticket machine and advised if I was going to the X-Ray department that I would only need to purchase 1 hour of parking. Upon entering the building I immediately knew where to go due to effective wall and floor signage. I presented my documents at reception and was pointed in the direction of the waiting area. After 10 minutes I was invited into the X-Ray area by a very personable radiographer. They guided me through the procedure and took time to check I was clear about what the procedure would do to assist my GP or specialist to deliver the appropriate response to my condition. I left the X-Ray Department at approximately 12.30 thinking ""what an excellent service""!

393458,"My little girl got chicken pox a few days before her third birthday. She became very unwell over the course of a few days and despite visiting various GPs on a daily basis the infection and then sepsis she went on to develop was unfortunately undiagnosed. When I called 999 she was at times incoherent, not urinating, and had a red rash rising up her stomach. The paramedic was unconcerned but agreed to take her into Luton and Dunstable ED. And it was there that our luck changed. We were met by a professional, highly competent team of medical professionals including nurses, consultants and anaesthetists who identified the sepsis immediately. Their prompt identification and treatment of sepsis is what saved her life. Unfortunately my daughter was in septic shock when she arrived at hospital so she required sedation, intubation and transfer to a paediatric intensive care in a different hospital. She spent 5 days on ICU and a further 2 on the ward before returning home. She was incredibly unwell and it was clear that we could have easily lost her. Luton and Dunstable gave her the best chance of survival - they geared her up for the fight she had ahead of her. And my strong girl made it through. We still have my daughter in our lives because of the staff at Luton and Dunstable ED. Thank you with all of my heart.",1

I should like to thank, and commend most highly, the work of the RBH and in particular the work of the ENT department. Every appointment and procedure was carried out by cheerful and sensitive staff, who always treated me, the patient, in a way that was inclusive and informative. I was given the opportunity to ask questions and felt a part of the decision making procedure. All information was available to pre-read and was easy to understand!

393943,"Our son aged 10 only a few weeks ago became extremely poorly at home, he was sick, weak, had neck stiffness and drowsiness with a temperature. Over a very short period I (Mum) noticed spots progressing very rapidly over his body. I rang NHS direct who sent an emergency response team who then called for an ambulance who took us to Blackpool Victoria Hospital. When we first arrived he got put on the Paediatrics ward, then to Emergency Resuscitation. We knew then our son was extremely poorly and was worryingly deteriorating fast, he was put on Intravenous antibiotics and relevant pain relief. He then moved to the Paediatric High Dependency Unit. This was confirmed meningococcal septicaemia and suspected Meningitis, he carried on with Intravenous antibiotics and stronger pain relief. All the Nurses and Doctors was very caring and extremely helpful. He then started having seizures, he became unresponsive when he was having the fits and they became more frequent. The Consultants and Doctors decided it was best to put our son in an induced coma on a ventilator to stabilise his body and so his body could concentrate on fighting the infection. He was put on the Intensive Care Unit and later had a brain scan. The NWTS team where called by the hospital they did the transfer of our son requiring admission to intensive care at Alder Hey children's hospital, the NWTS team did an excellent job. We was frantic with worry it was the worse time of our life, our son was full of tubes and critically poorly on a ventilator. Alder Hey hospital Paediatric Intensive Care Unit was very professional, and their care was second to none. We would like to thank everybody at Blackpool Victoria hospital and Alder Hey hospital, all the Nurses, Doctors and Consultants who looked after our little boy and saved his life they was absolutely brilliant. A massive thank you from our family.",0

At all times procedures and actions were fully explained. I have the highest regard for the nursing staff who work very hard in what are at times difficult circumstances. The only area I can sugggest for improvement is information as to how to care and exercise post discharge. Earlier in the year the department download menu had a PDF for care following this operation but it seems to have disappeared. I think on discharge the patient could be handed a simple printed sheet of do and don't s, along with suggested timeline for beginning neck exercises. Please keep up the good work.

394790,"I had reason to visit the treatment centre today, and noticed the following: When the doctor was checking my details on the computer screen, it overlapped with several other patient details - name, date of birth, number of appointments they've had (all personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 and General Data Protection Regulation 2016). When the doctor had to pop out of the room the computer was not locked and I therefore had free reign to do what I wanted with the computer, though I am not that way inclined because it is wrong, not in accordance with the law, and obviously I did not have permission to access patient details. Upon my return I advised the doctor that I'm a Solicitor and my specialism just happens to be information law, and advised what I observed. Upon the doctor leaving the room the second time the computer was not locked, so I immediately challenged this and to my dismay found that the doctor did not know how to lock the computer, and therefore I explained how to do this. Information Governance and HR - I am sure the Information Commissioner's Office would be interested to hear of this. You ought to train your staff in the importance of data protection compliance. We the public trust you with our personal data, and sensitive personal data and want assurance that you are looking after it.

It was almost as if they needed the bed and wanted her out as soon as possible. 8) The last time my mother was Admitted, I attended the hospital but was told at reception that she was not at the Royal Free which was incorrect, they simply failed recorded her details on the Hospital admission system in timely manner and I left upset because I was able to see my mother.

I agree that everybody is entitled to treatment but is it acceptable therefore to expect a ten year old visitor to be subjected to full body exposure from a middle aged man?

I am truly grateful and I appreciated their follow-up and willingness to answer questions also. A big thank you to all of them. Keep up the good work! Everyone was very nice, and it is nice to be treated well since you are the patient in need of help. I was very well taken care of. The Doctors, surgeons, nurses & staff are professional and very thorough in the operative theatre as well as in the outpatient eye department. I was welcomed with friendly staff and they were very helpful. The pre-op wait was under an hour and Doctors and nurses were very nice and helpful in explaining and assessing the pre-op care. Indeed a courteous and professional staff throughout my journey from outpatient to the post-op care and the subsequent follow-ups in the OPD. Surgeon has been a skillful professional eye surgeon and I cannot begin to express my satisfaction with them and their team. From the front desk to the nurses, and the doctor, each and every one of them was courteous, professional, and made my visit as comfortable as they possibly could. Please forward my thanks on to each and every one of the staff there. From “What patients want” (as recommended by the Picker Institute, www.pickereurope.org), I have identified those issues and correlated it to my cataract surgery care under the team at the QMC. My experience has been very positive and briefly as follows: •	A fast access to reliable health advice for the deterioration in eyesight with posterior cataract and other associated eye comorbidities. •	An effective treatment delivered by trusted professionals (Professor and team at the QMC). •	A participation in decisions and respect for preferences (eg choice of anesthesia, cataract surgery and the implantation of lens etc.) •	A clear, comprehensible information and support for self-care, for example, pre- & post-op cataract surgery care, Q & A and the access to emergency numbers, leaflets, brochure etc. •	An attention to physical and environmental needs (placed in different air-conditioned rooms during the pre-op and post-op period, other comorbidities checked and observed), offered hot tea/coffee with a smile! •	An emotional support, empathy, and respect for the patient during the whole process. •	Finally the continuity of care and smooth transitions to post-op follow-up appointments I am writing to thank your entire staff for the excellent care received during my visit to the eye department over last 6 months at the QMC, Nottingham,",0
400645,"Was really impressed with the service I received today. Physio really good, knowledgeable and provided with a few exercises which I can cope with. Felt happy and confident with a good service and God willing hopefully a speedy recovery. I have received lots of physio treatments over the years, both private and nhs. It's so good to see nhs staff who provide a service similar to private! Obviously it can be hit and miss, it's down to the professional/individual. You get good and not so good in all walks of life. Only problem was the physiotherapy service not easy to find. It's on B floor! You have to head to the WRVS coffee shop and there's a sign there telling you to go right.(little tip).",0
401765,"Awful experience. The nurse who gave my child a blood test was not understanding of his age or needs. They didn't reassure him, was abrupt in their instructions on how to sit, abrupt with me, and even though he had the gel on they went in on the arm and my son felt it all. When he began to cry the nurse called him a baby. Shocking to think a professional nurse could belittle a child in pain. Having had several blood tests over the last year in hospital all the good work done by staff to a child when having bloods done has been lost.",0

402135,"Our friend was sent away from a and e with pain killers after having severe back pain. It got worse and he lost weight rapidly and went jaundice. He was admitted by ambulance and stayed in C7 for 2 weeks and was discharged with pain killers, he deteriorated rapidly, became confused and had no strength at all. We called an ambulance and was admitted again, moved to hdu and died the next day all alone because the hospital failed to contact his next of kin to say he was dying. We had his funeral yesterday. This was a 47 year old man who will be missed dearly by all. Why was he even discharged in such a state in the first place? 8 weeks ago he had back pain and now he's dead. We are all in shock and feel this hospital failed this man. He had no family only close friends.",1
402007,"I recently visited the Audiology Dept where I have received respectful & informed professional NHS care for my hearing loss for the past 10 years. However, I was shocked to see that the department was obliged to display an advertisement & leaflets by a private hearing aid supplier !! I think it is outrageous that the Trust allows such private medicine advertising on their premises & would counsel anyone seeing this advert to understand that most hearing losses can be adequately & satisfactorily improved by the advice & NHS hearing aids which the Audiology Dept. staff provides free of charge to eligible people. However, the private supplier may be able to give advice on & sell audio enhancing accessories & equipment which may not be available from the Audiology Dept in the hospital. I consider the question regarding same-sex accommodation in this review totally irrelevant in this context, so decline to answer it.",0
402056,My Mother is a 76-year-old who is waiting for a knee replacement and she is registered with Whiston hospital she was told she would have an injection every 3 months to ease the pain she last had her injection 5 and half month ago so she phoned Whiston hospital and they said no injection till December 2017 so she phoned her GP to be told she would have to wait for another 4 weeks so that's 3 and a half months of no pain relief whatsoever the pain on her face makes me cry because she is in so much agony.,1

We did not know that the unit was to closed at 4pm. On our arrival at 4pm, the staff took our urgent request and process the x-ray request. It is much appreciated.

Urgent Care unit was also helpful advising us that if we have a form from the GP, we should proceed to the X-ray department. Thank you.",0
402217,"Today I called up the Health centre to book an appointment, I have called within the given opening time of 8AM - 8PM. Having been on the phone for 46 minutes with no answer and being placed number 1 in the call list for 40 minutes of the 46 minutes I waited, for the line to just go dead with no answer no explanation as to why I was waiting for so long. This is really really bad why can I not make an appointment at my local Doctors for? And why am I paying my NI contributions when I can't even see a GP? Awful service.",0

405745,"My father woke at 11. 30pm with bad chest pains. Having had a heart attack a few years previously he understood the symptoms. He called himself an ambulance and woke my step mother. She then called me. I arrived half an hour later my dad was grey, breathless and clammy. I called the ambulance again. And explained the situation. They told me an ambulance was on its way. 1 hour later the ambulance arrived. So a total of 90 mins waiting for an ambulance. I understand ambulance staff are stretched but I feel this was a real emergency and feel this was far too long to wait. In the hospital my dad, step mum and I were in the ED until 8 am before he saw a doctor. who informed us he would be staying in. He was transferred to a renal ward as there were no spaces on the coronary ward. 2 days later he was transferred to a coronary ward. Where he was diagnosed as having suffered an angina attack. And had to have a stent inserted. Luckily this was a positive outcome. However I feel a 90 minute wait for an ambulance is unacceptable.",1
406081,"I took my mum here today as she's had a swollen and very painful foot for over a week now and we weren't sure why it was causing her trouble as she hadn't damaged it herself. My mum had trouble walking so we took her here for help, only for the disrespect and arrogant triage nurse to tell my 45 year old mum that she “shouldn't have come up” as it wasn't an emergency. It's a walk in centre, she was in agony so I think it's disgusting to repeatedly tell my poor mum that she was wasting her time coming. There were no other people waiting to be seen so she wasn't wasting anyone's time. If that wasn't rude enough, the ‘nurse' told her she needs to “look after” herself more, when my mum is in great shape and totally healthy! All in all, the nurse my mum saw was rude and had an appallingly attitude, leaving my mum disheartened and me fuming when we left. I don't recommend anyone to go here as the service is utterly disgusting",0
406104,I attended with my daughter for virus/tonsillitis and tight chest. My daughter suffers badly with panic attacks and anxiety so on arriving at the hospital the Triage Nurse saw us quickly and was very considerate of my daughter's anxiety so placed us in a quiet area of the waiting room. We were seen extremely quickly by a nurse (who's name I can't publish here) but they were absolutely wonderful. They calmly and rationally dealt with my daughter's issue and I was amazed at how understanding she was. My daughter left there feeling very very reassured and I was very grateful to the nurse who took the time with my daughter.,0
406166,"I received a letter showing time to arrive at Hope ward (7am) on 19th October. Duly arrived at 7 am to find approx 20 people waiting at the door (for similar urology appointments). We were let in at 7 am. I was sent to a waiting area at approx 7.15am. I was seen by a very nice registrar at approx 11am , and told that I was last on the list for the day! Next, a visit from the anaethetist shortly after, also a very nice person. Next, I was taken to a single bed room in Hope ward to change, and then had to wait again until 3 pm when I was taken to the operating theatre for procedure. Although the wait was unacceptable (Why are appointments not staggered ?) the Consultants ,Registrar , and team were excellent and very helpful and supportive.",0
406340,"I had read and heard of other complaints about women being forcibly restrained by all male staff when in mental distress and that complaints made before. So I was frightened when they said my mother had been taken there by ambulance. She wasn't sectioned so was legally free to leave unless they wanted to. There were NO nurses at all just 2, male security guards standing outside the door which they had shut so she couldn't open as there is no handle on the inside. By the time we got there she still 3 hrs later hadn't been seen clinically at all not even to triage or do basic observations. She is extremely claustrophobic has been a victim of abuse and was obviously in extreme distress. Security guards were rude and aggressive towards us until we invited them to call the police as at least she would then be safe. When we pushed past she had been left curled up on a filthy rubber matress, no blanket, no pillow, no food and water and absolutely no way of summoning help as no alarm bells. I feel It is disgusting that those who are violent or drunk get clinical care yet a frail terrified woman with no violence history gets manhandled repeatedly by male security staff. Why aren't they chaperones? Why wasn't she allowed to be in dignity? The nursing sister in charge actually said to us we don't want mental health patients here we don't have the staff. In Islington the A& E is ONLY MH place as she knows. To leave someone that distressed and to allow male security staff to use language and aggression towards her I feel is disgusting. Where were the nurses? Where were the MH team? Disgusting. . CQC have since told us that the MH area of the A& E here failed their inspectione.",1
407942,"The care I received at the marshes was excellent, from the first phone call, to my latest appointment, the staff are always friendly, courteous and professional.

Simply excellent. With special thanks to the Dr, and nurses, as well as the front desk and no doubt the rest of the team. Please keep up the good work it is appreciated.",0
408662,"I have a long term digestive problem which requires a gastroscopy & botox injections at fairly short notice every 2-3 months. The staff in endoscopy are always incredibly happy & friendly & treat me so incredibly well. My consultant has to be the nicest & most cooperative consultant in the whole NHS & gives me the most wonderful treatment, often at less than 2 weeks notice. In the last 2 years they have improved the quality of my life beyond belief. Finally the tea & biscuits which are served in recovery taste like the world's best. Thank you all so very much.",0
408898,"My husband was taken to LH A&E by ambulance suffering severe abdominal pain at 8am. After approx 2 hours of treatment, blood samples and scans he was diagnosed with a suspected gallstone attack. He was given strong pain relief. He went to sleep. At 6.15 pm he was on a surgical ward. He had been monitored constantly in A&E in kept comfortable in a cubicle. I was brought cups of tea and a sandwich. We were told he might have an operation or drugs might sort out the gall bladder inflamation. After 5 days of excellent and kind care he was discharged with his gall bladder intact. Antibiotics and painkillers had cured the infection. We both have nothing but the highest praise for the 111 operator, the 2 East Midlands ambulance staff, and everyone at Lincoln Hospital. There are signs of wear and tear and overstretched staff/ equipment but they handle it all magnificently.",0
411984,"I am utterly disgusted and upset the way my mother was treated after falling and injuring her head. The paramedics were great at the scene and en route, unfortunately once at Fairfield it was quite noticeable that staff were to put it mildly ‘not bothered'. My mother is in her late 70's and particularly in view of the fact that she suffered severe trauma to the back of her head was not even offered a scan to see if any damage had been done. She further complained of headache and was not offered/given any pain relief, and was sent home after the wound was cleaned and bandaged. It appeared to her and my father, that as she was brought in from a pub, which is across from her home and she fell into the road outside after trying to get onto the pavement (she hadn't even got into the pub where she was going for a meal when she fell and was taken into the pub by members of the public who stopped their car in the middle of the road to help her and my dad), that she had been drinking (which was not the case). I would have thought that due to the injury sustained she should have had a scan and kept in for observation not allowed to go home, due to her age and vulnerability. My mother herself felt that due to her age she was not given the service/attention required.",1

417650,"I visited the hospital with my 18 year old son who was directed to paediatrics which was totally overrun with very small children. We were ignored for 10 minutes and then told to sit in the teenagers room which was still overrun with babies. The service was appalling, staff unfriendly and appeared to have no concerns about the agony my son was suffering. It really needs a complete overall and a senior member of staff to facilitate better care.. if my son hadn't been in so much pain we would have moved on to a better hospital.",0
420090,"Brought my 3 year old son to A&E after he had a high fever, was throwing up all liquids/solids, lethargic, complaining of stomach pain and loss of appetite. Very busy and was seen by an assessment nurse who said he may have fever because of an ear infection and to just wait to be seen...we waited 4 hours and had still not been seen, staff did not care that my young child was seriously ill, others who arrived after us were seen before. After it being over 4 hours we decided to drive to Kingston A&E instead and were seen swiftly by very nice nurses who told us he had appendicitis and would need emergency surgery. Good thing we left as the surgeon told us had my son not been operated on that night he would have died as the infection had started spreading to other organs.",1
425217,"I am horrified by the the way my elderly Father is bein* treated at this hospital (Thistle Ward). He was admitted on Thursday night, 27 October, as he was seriously ill and had a very bad infection, and we were Informed that he was developing septicaemia. In spite of his medical condition when we rushed to the hospital at about 2300hrs he was lucid and was glad to see his family. On Sunday when he visited him, he told us that he was lying in excrement for long time and when he imformed the night nurses to clean him they just did not bother. Another patient who was in the same bay as my Dad said that the two nurses were watching a horror movie and shouted at my Father! What kind of nursing staff does Newham employ - I feel you are scrapping the of the barrel when it comes to recruiting your nurses. My Father hasn't had a decent meal since he has been in hospital as he keeps throwing up. When I mentioned this to the doctor today (1st Nov), they informed me that they saw him eating, but having three small spoonfuls of Weetabix is not a proper meal. Since he has been in hospital he has not had any lunch or dinner. In spite of not eating he has diarrhoea frequently and the doctors need to investigate why this is happening. This evening (2 Nov) my Fath er was transferred to a side room and am very concerned that they will just forget about him and he will be covered in excrement as there are no other patients who can raise the alarm. My sister visited him this evening and found he had no nappy or blankets on him. My Father went into hospital with a fully functioning brain but lack of liquid, food and care has reduced him to a shadow of his former self. Please look after your frail patients. As no one is listening to the family's concerns, I feel the next step is his MP. I did speak to PALS at the hospital today but I had the feeling that it was a waste of time. I am so worried that my Father might be treated badly by the unprofessional nursing staff in the side room where there are witnesses. Such a disgusting hospital for not caring.",1
426830,"I have had to visit the staff at the retford site. I have had this service else where in the past and feel these are the best. My first visit I saw a staff member and was pleased and satisfied with their help knowledge and support, they have perfect people skills. the next visit I was put in front of the head of Physiotherapy. this person was outstanding in service knowledge expertise and approachable, there was nothing they would not or could not do for you My third visit was specialise one of 6 patients on a 4 week visit to help as follows: We all learned about our bodies muscles and nerves that work hard for us, the information made us aware of our ailments and how best to overcome problems, the meeting was extremely informative friendly and they were great a perfect tutor in their area, polite friendly and full of advice & knowledge, we all left knowing more and exercises to do before the second session, I am very impressed with the services provided and the hospital which is warm and welcoming. The hygiene is spot on in all areas, you feel welcome which helps when suffering and in need of the great service provided. I cannot recommend a better hospital and service, I look forward to the next visit.

430718,My family and I have been under the PSGP for well in excess of 40yrs and the service is just quite simply first class. We have always received first rate service and the follow up is second to none. As I say all the Doctors there are just first class and my family and I consider ourselves very lucky to be under their care. I hope the powers that be within the NHS will recognise this and use this practice as a benchmark or a model for how other Group Practices should operate. The NHS is a national treasure and all that work within the NHS are jewels in the crown of the NHS. I'd finally just like to say a very big thank you to all the staff at the PSGP and wish them all the very best for the future. Thank you,0

Soon as baby was born he was given to me and after 30 mins taken and passed to my husband. Baby had pooped inside the womb so needed extra checks. However, nobody checked him even after being passed to my husband I had gone into theatre and baby still hadn't been checked for 40 further minutes until my husband had to press emergency button as he wasn't breathing very well. No one changed him or clothed him and he hadn't eaten in three hours. Very distressing terrible midwife. I hope noone has to suffer this way",1
431279,Cardiologist at this hospital purely give lip service and rely purely on tests that fit you into text book categories and pretend to listen to you. Your lucky to see the Same one twice and have to waste time going over things with each new one you see. You never get to see them in person to discuss the out come of any test or explain anything. If you get a copy of the three line letter they send to your GP your lucky! This department and every other is purely interested in getting you seen and fobbed off in order to meet targets.

It has now been 5 weeks with no further appointment for the results of the monitor. Twice I have phoned the secretaries office, who are very polite - no complaint there, but am told to ring again next week. I get the impression there is no real organisation within the department.

Diabolical ignorance and complete lack of care, respect and professionalism under such stretched rushed conditions. Turned out she had infection.

Unlike my previous sexual health centre, you are assigned a unique 'name' after you register.

Doctors just want him to go home and think my elderly mother can cope. She can't. No district nurses have been arranged so we have refused to let them discharge him. One doctor actually told him the hospital was for patients with acute problems, not people who ""won't get better"". If he is at End of Life then why isn't he in a hospice not an old, noisy ward. Since we refused to take him home he is all of a sudden very drugged up and dozy and unable to make sense - very unusual don't you think?

437285,"I was admitted to AMU on thursday evening with heavy internal bleeding after my doctors felt concerned. The admittance was stress free and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful doing their best to ease my concerns. A doctor saw me quickly and by 01am friday morning I was moved to Conservators ward as the AMU bed was needed. That said it was professional and I was kept informed. The new ward was pleasant, the staff cared for me putting my mind at ease and treating me with dignity and respect, I am a large person and need an electric wheelchair for my main mobility, so my needs were demanding regarding toileting etc for staff who were willing and friendly doing all they could to help me and ensure my visit was truly as stress free as could be, and ensuring I received the care I needed. I was given an OGD and Maria my nurse stayed with me doing her best to reduce stress and I was pleased the results were normal, however I will be having a colonoscopy soon as the bleeding never stopped until Sunday morning. My one concern was the rooms were uncomfortably hot, [Happy with 'Staff attitude'] [Happy with 'Staff skills'] I was discharged on Sunday afternoon the ambulance service was first rate and they took me home.

The way in which the team worked together caring for and collaborating with each other to in turn provide perfect care to me and the other patients stil brings a tear to my eyes two weeks afterwards. In business and technology organisations and students, teamwork is acknowledged as key to success - but real-time, life and death decisions are rarely (ever) involved. Your level of professional and caring teamwork took this to a new level - what an amazing learning experience for your students as well. Bless you all from the bottom of my heart",0

This happened most days. Sick stains left on end of bed and table for 3 days until I cleaned them. After he had his op he was left in dirty blood stained sheets and gown. Again we had to sort this out. The vac drain that he had was not looked after properly as no one seemed to know how to work it. This is a surgical ward. How can the nurses not know how to empty and reactivate a vac drain. Very poor care all round. He had a bad sore on both sides of his body that were just left. Upon discharge his wound was not checked and meds he was supposed to have were not been prescribed. Very poor.",1

The entire team - from the ""meet and greet"" to the ""support teams"" and ""consultants"" are all extremely professional and courteous, yet retain that personal touch (and genuine interest) in the patients. Appointments are not rushed; patients questions and concerns are listened to and answers/reassurances provided - in plain English - in sum, the whole process in my experience, is 100% satisfaction and total confidence that I am in good hands. Particular recognition of outstanding service must go to the consultant in Rheumatology and also a nurse in Orthotic Clinic at the Bingley Canalside location, although as mentioned above, the entire team at Airedale are worthy of recognition for service excellence.",0

I have requested emailed results and, on some occasions, have been lucky. This means I can then book a test for the following week in plenty of time. Mostly they 'forget' to send me an email and post the results, which not only costs the NHS the price of a stamp, but means I get the results 2 days later, so I am unable to book a further test at a premium time for me to get to the clinic. I have made numerous phone calls but they keep reverting back to the postal option, which I find extremely annoying.",0

The only staff who did anything on there were the students. My mothers insulin was missed the nurses just had no knowledge or understanding of how serious diabetes can be. Had to speak with manager pals & doctors due to lack of care. Who gives cold water to patients to wash with? Its no wonder the hospital CQC repoted as inadequate.

Vending machine selection is rather nasty and unappetizing a few sandwiches 4 fruit and a load of chocolates... This cafe at the main entrance should be open 24hrs a day..... I've been here Over the years visiting family and such and all I remember about the place is the poor facilities for food and beverage.. Let's get into the current century and get an independent Small business with amazing healthy food like current healthy eating options and barista type coffee and hot drink solutions. The price you pay for a bean to cup tasteless coffee here at The hospital is not far off a great coffee from an independent coffee house... Surely there is a need for the staff working here and the emergency staff going and coming to have a decent level of food and beverage on site for them.. Yesterday I saw the cafe serve chips and cheap 8s sausage the type you get at a local greasy spoon place. It's a hospital and you should insist on healthy options always as a policy.... Don't any body know about saturated fats at this hospital clogging up arteries etc... RUN sort this mess out. Everyone want to knock off early....

They are also professional and the unit seems very well run in that delays on my appointment time were infrequent, in spite of the high number of patients to be seen. My thanks go to all the team.

450970,"My husband was brought in for an appendicectomy. Yes, waiting times are long (he waited 36 hours for the operation) however that was not the worst of it. The surgeon and staff who operated on him were wonderful - what had initially seemed like a borderline case of appendicitis turned out to be a very serious one and keyhole surgery had to be abandoned for a full laperotomy. He was in an extreme amount of pain following the operation, and nearly lost part of his large intestine as the gangrenous infection was so severe. Care immediately following the surgery was good. We were told he would be in hospital 3 to 5 days as it had been a major operation and a major infection. However just over 24 hours after surgery, no staff was left that had been there during his operation and it was a completely different story. A registrar did morning rounds and told him he should be discharged. My husband could not walk unaided at this point, and was still on intravenous morphine. They did not examine his wound. When he later saw the pain management nurse, they told him he should stay 1to 2 more days. He had been prescribed regular doses of oral pain killers also, however the nursing staff were not bringing it to him. No-one would answer his call button at night, he forced himself to shuffle to the nurses station to ask for it. I was afraid to leave him at night, and spent the whole of the visiting times from morning to evening at his side to try and ensure adequate care. I had to fight for the staff to understand that he needed to stay longer in hospital. Eventually the consultant who had performed his operation came and confirmed that he was not ready to be discharged and apologised for the registrar's mistake. However the same registrar came the following morning and blamed my husband for the fact they had said he should be discharged. My husband was vulnerable, in extreme pain and had been treated poorly by this doctor and yet they continued to mistreat him. This registrar was unpleasant, brusque and dangerous. And because we questioned them, and complained that the nurses were not administering the prescribed painkillers, we were subjected to a toxic, compassionless environmwnt. I am frankly terrified of ever needing hospital treatment at York and will avoid at all costs.",1

It was then followed by shockingly long labour and an infection caused by being examined internally by too many doctors against my will. After emergency c section I was left for several hours behind the curtain without the buzzer and a baby couple of meters away. To make it ever more traumatic I was given drugs I was allergic to and was left to my own devices with severe anemia. It left me traumatised for several months and unable to even drive past the hospital. Some midwifes feel like they are Gods.,1

My Gran had been admitted for angina and it turns out she had a stroke in their care and they had not even realised. The nurse was rude and I have no doubt that my Gran could have had a full blown heart attack and they still to now would not have checked on her unless I approached again. When asked, they had no idea what she had eaten or drank throughout the day but recorded she was eating well- turns out she hadn't. They left her medication on the side of the table but did not check she had actually taken it- she hadn't even known the medication was for her. Shocking service!",1

A&E and AAU, where she was admitted, completely ignored the involuntary movements and spent the whole time worrying about her blood pressure which, as is usual when there are doctors around. Of course there was no attempt to find the cause of the high blood pressure, just an insistence that it must be brought down. One has to wonder if these doctors ever do diagnosis.

By this time the baby was in distress and the midwife panicked and started shouting at my wife which caused mass panic to us all, this resulted in our son being born in mass shock and needing to be treated for suspected HIE.

Initially my second appt for the 24hr tape was later that afternoon but the department offered to fit my tape there and then to avoid a return trip and to fit it in the scan room to avoid re-dressing and undressing again.

It takes too long to find basic information and leaves you frustrated. On the plus side the staff and people working are helpful when you do manage to get your call answered so no complaints there.

Just to let you know, the ENT department doesn't feature on the drop down menu for the department visited section below. Not all of the departments are available on the list.",0
457947,"I was fitted with new hearing aids just before Christmas and am so pleased with them - a big improvement on previous ones (fitted five years earlier). I know that technology improves all the time but I also so much appreciate the skills of the audiologist(s) in the fitting and adjusting of the aids. The service (including after service) is excellent. Having hearing aids that work so well is fantastic, really enhances the quality of everyday life so much. I forget I'm wearing them and can enjoy social situations particularly so much more now that background noise is less of an issue. Thank you so much.",0
458031,"arrived with my 91 year old Father who was in pain with a catheter and bleeding heavily, he also has dementia. only 4 people in A&E including a homeless man that was lying across 4 seats snoring, he had wet and soiled himself the smell was disgusting. Was given a card then told to go to reception, again had to explain the reason we were there, told to take a seat. After 1 hour called by nurse, again explained the reason we were there, blood pressure taken, told to take a seat. Another 2 hours later taken to another nurse, again had to explain why we were there. Catheter removed and put back in, by now my father was bleeding quite badly, told he had to be seen by a doctor. My dad was very sore by then and wanted to lye down, told he had to take a seat. 2 hours later doctor arrives, he says they are worried a blood clot may form and block his catheter, he would like to admit him but no beds, again I asked if he could lye down, and was told no, sorry no beds or trolleys available. A drunk consistently bothered by father, swearing and interfering with him, security kept on having to take him away, filthy floors, awful place, my fathers first time in Kent, as we have moved him from Essex, hopefully his last, shameful way to treat the elderly, the lady next to us had been there in a chair for 17 hours waiting for a bed, and when we left the stinking homeless man was still there.

That afternoon, I received a call from a junior doctor to say that the cancer had spread to his liver. The doctor stated that the hospital would not allocate him an acute bed as he was going to die soon anyway, and sent him back to the care home. After 11 days in pain and great distress he died on 23rd December. The reader can judge for him/herself.",1

One issue that concerns me relates to the whiteboard in Reception. The staff on duty are all listed on this board but some are listed with a title, first name & surname, whilst others are only listed with first names. It doesn't take long to realise that the ""higher-up"" employees are those that have titles & full names & that it's the nurses, clerical & domestic staff that are known only by first names. This indicates inequality & implies that different levels of respect are awarded to different levels of staff. Is this the intention? How does such a policy come into existence?

Phoned at 8:30 am on 18th to cancel and rearrange due to insufficient notice to enable me to pre-arrange absence from work.

Treatment - Operation Team Again, I received an extremely high level of care from Mr Sheridan and his team. This included information on the procedure, honest responses to my numerous questions, re-assurance when required and efficient and seemingly well coordinated team effort. In my role as a management trainer I have been expounding the virtues of effective teams and team working for over thirty years but, like many people, (unfortunately) rarely see this in practice - either in private or public sector organisations.

463737,"Although I had to wait a while for my tests, the overall atmosphere was very professional, pleasant and friendly. The facilities were clean and the staff at the front desk and in the area providing the tests were very knowledgeable and indeed approachable. During the tests the staff member was very reassuring and clearly understood their subject and provided initial feedback in a professional and easy to understand format. Although the appointment was late I was offered free parking for the main car park, which to say the least is considerate and more than fair. I would say that on this occasion I could note take this up as I parked just off the main entrance. I normally park there for two reasons, cost, but also because it is easier for me to walk up to the hospital, I would rather not park in the main car park which is nearer, just in case family members need to park for more serious cases and they find it easier to gain access to the main entrance.",0

Cardiology Appointments now had three days to find multiple faxes. They 'found' appointment when I stood over them for 25+ minutes. This followed repeated calls to GP to confirm that fax was sent whilst standing at Cardiology reception. GP surgery had evidence that fax was sent.

462819,I am writing on behalf of my late father-in-law who died in the hospital on December 23rd aged 87. John Connolly was admitted by ambulance after a dizzy spell. The ambulance arrived within three minutes. He was known to the hospital so he bypassed A&E and after a couple of days in the acute assessment unit he was admitted to a geriatric ward where he stayed for about ten days before dying peacefully in his sleep. It was obvious from the start that he had little time left as the tests showed progressive organ failure but the medics didn't let up in their care. He was monitored day and night and the ward was always well staffed. Towards the end he was moved to a private annex at the end of the ward where John's wife and his two daughters stayed with him for three nights. Blankets and refreshments were offered and everything possible was done to make his last hours comfortable. In conclusion I have nothing but praise for the hospital staff and wish to say loud and clear DON'T KNOCK THE NHS!,0

Staff all positive and supportive. 1. Appointment booked and text reminder all very efficient 2. Car park easy and nearby plus inexpensive 3. Waiting room clean and near to reception area 4. Prompt reception sign in, clear communication 5. Not a long wait before I saw consultant who examined me then explained the stages I would go through next 6. Again short wait before mammogram, lady introduced herself and procedure 7. Short wait before taken for Ultrasound, again all fully explained and staff professional, good communication and introduction 8.

I think nurses need to be taught how to cope in a noisy environment because they obviously couldn't handle his crying at the end of the day its a child if hes not well ofcourse he will cey in discomfort he cant speak to tell me whats wrong with him.,0

The treatment and care I received were excellent but I found myself deeply offended by comments made by one member of staff. When I was discussing what had happened with the doctor on duty I explained that the child in question was non-verbal, had a mental age of around 18 months old and was Autistic. I informed her that the child had bitten other members of staff before although not as bad but it was unintentional. The doctor made the commented that the child sounded mentally deranged, should be sectioned and put in Bushy Fields. I asked her to repeat what she had said as I thought I had misheard her to which she repeated her comment. I explained that the child was a 6-year-old little girl and I didn't believe a mental hospital was the place for an Autistic child. The doctor argued that if the said child was going around biting people she was obviously mentally deranged and should be put in a place where she is not a danger to others. I was both shocked and disgusted that a medically trained person could be so prejudiced towards a person with special needs and treat Autism as a mental illness in the 21st Century. Maybe the staff would benefit from some Autism Awareness training to dispell some of their misconceptions.",0

She was more worried about my sons surnames then getting help. I was told to have a sit and wait.People that arrived after us were called before us more than a hour passed when i started to make a fuss and asked why was it taking so long the receptionist told me they have been busy and my son was next. I do not understand how you access or prioritise your patients. When my son was finally called as soon as Drs and nurses saw his arm they apologised we had to wait so long to be seen. After the X-ray i was told my son needed surgery he was given morphine and was taken to MargateThe Queens Hospital by ambulance. Fantastic doctors and nurses! just a shame that my 5 year old son had to wait for about an hour and a half crying in pain. Please look into how you prioritise your patients.,0

As I cannot advise I will not attend the centre I cannot free up this appointment for another patient.

467395,I feel the signs for the car parking at Aldershot centre for health need to be reviewed. After speaking to others regarding parking at the health centre I have now found I am not alone with the issue I am currently having. It clearly displays FREE 15 MINITE PARKING which I am now being requested to pay £160 to a debt collector due to appealing the original £60 ticket I received. As in a hurry to pick up a prescription I did not get out of the car to read the significantly smaller and less bold small print advising you should enter your registration for this. I feel this too should be in bold and the cost of the fine itself should be addressed as it is far out of proportion for the financial situation of most residents in this area. I stayed in the car park for 9 minutes and am now expected to pay £160. I understand the NHS property services feels it benefits the money pot for local NHS services and facilities. But I think it is extortionate and financially crippling for those it catches out with the unfair signage.,0
467623,"My fiancée has PCOS and was also diagnosed with endromitiral hyplesia without atypia. The doctor that conducted the hysteroscopy has told her nothing but lies and has been nothing but inconsiderate. She was told she'd have to have a hysteroscopy, she was told it would cause a ""mild discomfort"" at most. She wasn't told to take an ibuprofen or paracetamol to help with the excruciating agony. Not like it would have helped, since it caused, as described, excruciating agony. My fiancée was bedbound after the procedure for months to come. So much even that tramadol was hardly enough to take the edge off the pain. She couldn't even sit in discomfort, let alone without pain. She was then told she'd need a marina coil and she was again told it would not hurt, ""you won't even feel it in there"" . She made the GP promise that she could make an emergency appointment to have it removed if it hurt. The GP promised and then placed the coil. Within a week my fiancée was in agony so we called to have it removed the same day. She was then told that the earliest appointment available was a week away. So she pulled the coil out herself. She was then put on the mini-pill, which caused her a migraine so horrendous that she was blinded. She couldn't stay awake for more than thirty minutes at a time. Her own chewing of food sounded what a siren blaring next to your ear would sound like to a normal person. Her moodswings on this pill became beyond violent, had she been in public she'd have been arrested. Right now she has been discharged without a direction, she has no clue what can be done and the NHS has not informed her about the numerous other procedures that can be done to determine whether her cells have become cancerous. Her gynaecologist hasn't even told her about the blood test that can be done to find out, they insist on shoving that barbaric mechanism back into her womb without any kind of anaesthetic. My fiancée has gone through so much psychical torment, emotional trauma and psychological distortion that she's at the point where she would prefer developing cancer instead of going through this butchery of a gynaecological procedure for preventative measures. Because if she developed cancer at least they would give her a hysterectomy and be done with it. I think for the 'most advanced health care system in the world' to make a patient feel like they would prefer cancer over treatment is shocking.",1

After receiving initial treatment in A&E, she was kept in EAU for three further nights after a CT scan showed minor bleeds on the brain. My mother is 86 and is beyond the onset stage of Alzheimer's. She is chirpy and usually easy going but being admitted to hospital was not easy. She had moments where her mood dropped, becoming very anxious and confused as to where she was. This once happened as I was leaving and when I alerted the nurse she did not hesitate to step in. When I returned my mother had recovered her spirits and was settled. I cannot thank the hospital and its staff enough for the excellent concern, treatment and care they gave my mother and their willingness to talk to me and discuss her progress.",0
468761,I was sent to the Tunbridge Wells Hospital by my doctor for excruciating stomach pains to the surgical assssment ward. I was admitted for investigation and found to be an infected gallbladder. I was treated very well and kept informed at all times. Once my pain was managed and I spent 3 days at the hospital I was discharged and told I would be having my gallbladder removed once the infection had gone. Unfortunately after a week at home I once again became very unwell and was re-admitted into the same ward. (I had blood test taken at the Gp surgery and received a call from the hospital informing me that my liver function was poor). My liver was affected and I had severe jaundice. I was in for 10 days and really can not fault the care I received both times. All staff were excellent and I was impressed with the care I received. I met with the consultant who booked in for gallbladder removal just after Christmas.,1
468989,"Visited the GI unit after an aggressive IBD flare up. The nurses were fantastic. Parking is a major challenge taking a good 20 minutes to find a spot. This leaves you running into the 30 minute window for the Parking Eye cameras so it will cost you £3.50 regardless to park. Of which one of the machines didn't work. Remember to keep your tickets as they may send you a bill even if you have paid, this has happened to me.

The local services provided by Chase Farm, Barnet and Potters Bar are very much what the local communities need and, in our direct experience, can generally be rated as both efficient and good. Alas, anything at Hampstead is extremely difficult to attend so we hope that the local services will be fully maintained. NHS receives a lot of flack so It is very important to say so when things go well, hence this review",0
469212,"My father was brought to A and E following a fall downstairs, my dad is suffering with vascular dementia,chronic kidney disease, pulmonary fibrosis and heart disease. He is 78. Whilst I appreciate the strains on the NHS at the moment and especially A and E what I am disgusted with is the fact he was left with head and neck blocks on until his CT scan could be read and sent to the department for almost 5 hours. In someone with dementia who doesn't under what is happening he became increasingly agitated. When he was eventually seen a nurse assessed his walking to see if he was fit to go home as the scans came back clear. He shuffled along for about 10 paces and was promptly discharged. No investigation into whether he had an underlying condition which had contributed to his fall. The ambulance crew who dealt with him said they thought he had a chest infection and or a UTI, this information was ignored along with the heart tracing they did which showed areas of concern. He was allowed home in the care of my mum who had shingles and a chest infection herself. On getting him home we found he still had a Canula in situ! All in all we were extremely upset by how he was dealt with. One nurse was an absolute diamond in how she dealt with him but as for the others I dread the thought of having to be treated at WRAE infirmary. Within 8 days at home he was diagnosed by his gp as having a chest infection and sent straight back to hospital where he was admitted finally. I know the dept was short staffed and busy but even so please treat patients like a human being instead of an inconvenience",1

Once Minor Injuries staff realised what had happened they took her and my dad into the unit to keep warm and looked after them, going above and beyond the call of duty, arranging an ambulance and doing all they could to help. I am so grateful for their kindness and compassion, even hugging my Dad after the ambulance left as he was obviously very distressed. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping make the best of an awful situation for my parents that day. Liz",0

There was a bit of a back-up today, which can sometimes happen if a lot of in-patients turn up for scans, but the staff kept me informed and were very personable. CT scans can be quite intimidating, but the staff work hard to make sure that you're comfortable, your dignity is protected, you understand what's happening and you are at your ease. Very professional service.",0
472266,"My mother was admitted to acute medical ward very recently with acute breathing problems and disorder which made her breathing much worse than it may have been. She had been advised by her general practitioner many times treatment of the disorder was impossible due to a complicated physical picture presented by her over many years. Within days of her admission treatment of the disorder began and her breathing issues lessened quite quickly . I am in awe of the professionalism and knowledge of staff nurse Laura who along with medical staff had the courage and foresight to treat my mother after such a long, long time of her suffering the debilitating effects of the disorder it is joyous to hear she is no long suffering as badly as before",0
472622,"The General STI service has mostly been good if I am direct and know what I want, however: 1. The only answer calls when there is a clinic on, i.e. not at lunch time, not often in the afternoon etc. They have a very annoying voicemail system that answers saying they are very busy, not to leave a message but call back later, then says leave a message - grrr 2. There is no easy way to cancel/change an appt or let them know you will be late - so I'm not surprised there are so many missed appointments! 3. The wait for STI check results is far too long!! When I go to London these are done within 3 working days, this clinic takes 2 weeks! 4 The standard of HIV care is basic. Constantly changing of doctors and all I hear is the patients are started on the most cost-effective treatments without checking resistances beforehand.",0
477648,"There must be some formula for working out when you will get seen at Salford Royal. I have come to this conclusion after yet another cancellation/rearranged appointment. It must be something like ""take the original date, add two weeks, factor in at least 2 postponements at 5 weeks each, plus a random postponement and add a random number of weeks"", which will give a result of ""sometime in the next year, but don't count on it"".

Filled in my number rating and added comments. Pressed send - failed, tried again, failed. SO, went to NHS website and pursued feedback ( not complaints) and now he lies my gripe ( forgive the intended pun ) Non-Medical services and staff drastically letting down the medical team. It has taken me 40 minutes to get to this point ( I consider myself relatively IT savvy too ) AND all I am trying to do is thank and support the med team. ANYWAY just to thank the team in the Leigh ( Hanover ) Endoscopy Unit for their kind, understanding, professional and knowledgeable care. They really do put you at ease and guide you through what could be a difficult procedure. For me they are an utter credit to the NHS and upper managment and beyond should be made to understand, daily, just how lucky they are to have such wonderful kind staff. Thank you so much guys",0

Was informed by the nurse there was nothing they could do so was advised to attend Barnet Hospital. We were given a list of emergency dentists for over 18 year olds when our child is only 5 years old. His wound wasn't even cleaned up and there was a miscommunication so his Dad had to remind the nurse that our boy needed pain relief, paracetamol.

I have had weekly contact with the hospital and and although I'm aware, this is not a priority for the consultants, it is for me as I have had 2 job offers which can't go through due to not having a valid licence.

496529,"During the past two years I have been unfortunate to need a number of scans, CT and Ultrasound.. The service of appointments and the scans have been nothing short of 100%, on each occasion, quality staff, full information, caring attitudes. I would point out one flaw in the system. Not everyone [including me] knows that there are two departments at which you might have your scan. The appointment sheet states; EDGH Eastbourne Radiology CT Scanning. The CT scanner room is in the main radiology department. On attending I reported to the Eastbourne Radiology CT Scanning reception, handed my form in and was told, 'I will inform them that you are here, take a seat'. That I did. 25 mins after my appointed time my name was called. The lady said, 'You are waiting in the wrong area you should have come to the Main Radiology Dept'. I replied 'I thought this was the Main Dept, I booked in and was told to wait here'. The same lady had collected a previous patient some 15 minutes before, so clearly I am not the only person to be misled. Essentially the fault of the receptionist. Two points arise; 1] The receptionist should fully read the appointment correctly and advise if you are in the wrong location, 2] The appointment letter should make it abundantly clear that the Main Radiology Dept is NOT the Eastbourne Radiology CT Scanning area. I believe that there is a confusion in the title of the two departments. This in no way detracts from my total satisfaction with the appointment service or scanning. Very much appreciated.",0

On G9 the staff were great and one doctor was brilliant when Ii arrived into the ward on the 16th to see my father and he looked very unwell. She went out of her way to come and explain that he had been very unsettled during the night ( apparently he had become very disorientated and taken out all his drip lines ) and re assured me that he was sleeping because he was exhausted. She did this without me having to ask how my Dad was simply because she could see that i was upset at seeing him look so unwell when I arrived into the ward.

505763,"I have already reviewed the excellence of the treatment I received during my hearing test yesterday (23 March). It could not have been bettered. And yes, I can now hear again! My concern relates to the processes at Reception on arrival. Having worked in a sector where late or non-arrivals for meetings cause immense anguish, I always ring ahead of any hospital appointment to confirm attendance, particularly as I had made the appointment last December. Thus it was that at 10.30, I rang ENT to confirm my 11.00 appointment. When I reached the clinic at 10.59 (I am nothing if not prompt!), a nurse was talking to the duty receptionist and so I waited. Another nurse joined her colleague and at 11.02 I stepped forward. I am a registered patient and was surprised at the length of time it then took to check in for a hearing test. With scarcely a glance at me and certainly with no welcoming smile, she stared at her screen. The interrogation began: Why are you here? Full name? Address? Post code? Date of Birth? Name of Doctor? Phone Number? No! Not your doctor's, yours? Emergency contact? After this staccato approach to checking in, the receptionist asked me to wait while she completed her form. I then waited even longer while she typed furiously. She is certainly a great touch typist and I am still wondering what more could possibly be needed to be recorded ahead of hearing test. Finally, and with no further questions, she despatched me to the seating area. What a welcome! Thank goodness that the hearing test that followed and the manner in which it was conducted was superb. ******************************************************* I am happy that my review is not published.

506495,"I've previously commented on inefficient admin and now have a further example. Seen by maxillo-facial consultant 28 February- it's now a month later and still awaiting the promised letter to my GP, copy to me. On the 15th March I phoned to be told that it normally takes a month, because ""the typing pool is very busy,"" but my letter had in fact been signed by the consultant the previous day. One would therefore expect to receive said letter by the 19th, allowing for the weekend and bulk mailing timescales. More than a week later still no letter. Comments: 1. If it usually takes a month that suggests a month is used as a process standard, rather than a management tool. Having managed departments, I know how easily people can think that and therefore actively delay actioning work. 2. It's a long time in the commercial world since I've heard of a typing pool and one assumes the hospital still operates that system because it thinks it's more efficient- that is not borne out in practice. My letter could easily have been completed at the time by the consultant or attendant nurse (who didn't seem to have anything else to do in my case). It could have been done, using a standard letter format and just filling in the boxes- it didn't need to be a finely crafted literary masterpiece. Accuracy is affected by delay 3. I cannot see how it can take so long to get letters, once signed, into the post. That, surely, is a simple, low cost process, which needs re-engineering to make it efficient.",0

Absolutely outstanding. Thank you.",0
507874,"I recently had day-surgery at UCLH and was very impressed by the efficiency and standard of care, from start-to-finish. The administrative staff were helpfully flexible in scheduling the initial diagnosis and pre-surgery appointments at a convenient time. At no point in the process did I have to wait for more than 5 minutes to be seen. The nurses who screened me for the operation beforehand were friendly and professional; the initial discussion with the surgeon was clear and helpful. A week or so before the operation, I had a telephone call to confirm all the arrangements. The operation itself ran very smoothly; I was cared for by 14 or 15 staff, all of whom were polite, friendly, efficient and good at their jobs. The wards were clean and comfortable. Thank you, everyone at UCLH!",0
508023,"Consultation 28 February, consultant's letter dated 6 March, date of posting per envelope 26 March, received 28 March. Letter wasn't actually signed by the consultant- it had the laughable stamp "" sent unsigned to expedite"". The letter recommended an ""urgent "" referral to another specialist. Is it acceptable to have to wait a month just for a written opinion? For a basic admin function, I find this poor. It will then lead to another delay whilst my GP takes the recommended action and an appointment is found.",1
508086,"Last week my very frail and increasingly confused 94 year old father had a fall and was admitted to Stoke Mandeville hospital . My father's physical and mental capacity has declined rapidly in the past year and if nature had been allowed to take it's course it is probable that he would have passed away relatively quickly and peacefullly. As it is, without consulting his family he was shunted to High Wycombe where a pacemaker was inserted and then deposited back to Stoke Mandeville. The first I knew of it was when I got a call from High Wycombe telling me he was on his way back. Since then my father has gone from bad to worse. He is now in a nursing home, in great distress, confused with sleepless nights and no quality of life. I wish the cardiologist who inserted this device could have sat with me in the nursing home as I spent two nights with my father waking every 15 minutes distressed and obsessively asking for his bottle as he can no longer walk to the lavatory. I wish he could experience the misery of a loving family whose only concern is the alleviation of suffering for a beloved husband and father. This kind of intervention is wonderful for some but for others like my father I think it is cruel and inhuman.",1
508723,"My grandson attended Kent and Canterbury, after seeing doctor was transferred to William Harvey. Doctors said his heart was racing but it couldn't be monitored because no beds were available ( he did explain it may be genetic, his Mother has cardiomyopathy and he had been waiting for tests). He then phoned 101 who were very helpful and made an appointment for 5pm with a doctor in Canterbury, who reassured him and said Kings College Hospital would be notified. But he was then told if he wanted medication he would have to drive to Hospital in Margate (a 36 mile round trip). Baring in mind he is unwell, frightened and also suffers with BPD I think his treatment so far is not satisfactory.",1
508846,"My husband was admitted through A&E with bronchial pneumonia. He was very ill and of course we were extremely worried about him. He was eventually admitted to Oken Ward and then latterly Fairfax Ward. Throughout his admission he was treated with the best treatment and support ever. The nurses and doctors throughout his stay were second to none. I can truly say they were amazing. My husband was extremely ill. They were all so dedicated to his care and recovery, I can't thank you enough. Thank you is not enough X",0
508997,"I contacted 111 as my daughter had developed croup overnight. I was given an appointment for 8. 15am at the out of hours at princess royal in haywards heath. we were seen by the doctor who asked what the problem was. I explained that my daughter has croup and she has had it previously and is also under a paediatric consultant at crawley hospital for her chest/asthma. after the 1st time of her having croup I was told by both the gp and consultant that if she gets it again to get her seen and steroids will be given to stop it getting worse. This doctor refused to give steroids and said she was fine and that all she has is flu even tho he heard her barking cough. This doctor couldn't take her oxygen levels properly as they did not have the correct machine for infants and proceeded to attempt to use the adult machine on her finger where they openly said it won't be accurate. she had no symptoms of flu and if she had I would have treated her at home for flu. The barking cough of croup is very distinctive. The Doctor said if she develops croup later than deal with it later. They was incredibly rude. My daughter deteriorated throughout the day with more barking coughing, struggling to breathe and high temp which was not coming down. She began vomiting too and I had to call an ambulance as she was sucking in her neck when breathing and had stridor. The paramedics could not understand why she had not been treated with steroids that morning. she got taken to a and e at east surrey and given steriods. Again the docs and nurses here could also not understand why she had not been treated for croup that morning. I think that should she have been treated properly by this doctor she would not have ended up in hospital. I am absolutely disgusted by the behaviour of this doctor and would like this to be looked into before more serious mistakes happen.",1
508947,"From beginning to end the experience on both occasions (both eyes done in the last 4 months) was informative, professional and of a high standard. Communication frrom the nursing staff to patients was clear and precise and between the Doctor and team present in surgery was excellent and preventative of mistakes being made. The nurses are of a high standard and approachable, and need to be commended for a job well done. Thank you for making these experiences as comfortable and pleasant as possible. The results and experience far outweigh any pre-operative apprehension and I would thoroughly recommend the surgery under the care if this great team.",0
508981,"I had operations to correct cataracts on both my eyes in 2017, in May and October. The whole experience from original contact with the team through all the functions to the operations was of the highest professional level. The information given was carefully reiterated and expanded at each stage. There was a significant change in the content over the 5 months between the operations. That is a great indicator of the professionalism of the whole department. Every member of the team was caring and supportive. The results were far in excess of my expectations, no optimistic claims were made but after 71 years of wearing spectacles for long sight and astigmatism, with additional support for loss of accommodation, I now have 20/20 vision - only using reading specs for very small type. I only expected less blurred vision but now the colours are so brilliant and everything is now so sharply in focus. I can only express my gratitude to every single member of the team from the telephone contact through the nursing team to the surgeons involved.",0
509804,Attending POW A&E on 14th January with my son who had a badly fractured collar bone. He was xrayed and told to go home and rest and take paracetamol. There was no follow up appointment given what so ever. 11wreks later he fell and took him to A&E again. We were told that the bone had started to heal but had joe moved due to the fall. Told to go home and rest and bring him back to fracture clinic a week later as this was the next available appointment. He has severe swelling and a badly disfigured looking shoulder. Nearly 12 weeks on with my poor son and we are no better off than the first break 11 weeks ago. Disgusted that no follow up appointment was given what so ever after the first break in January. Even nurses when taken back the second time were shocked no follow up was given. Not happy at all ...,1

Long story short had to call an ambulance when he slipped into unconsciousness and he was rushed to A&E where they advised potential pneumonia- he still there now 3 days later!

513081,"My 84 year old father with advanced COPD and Alzheimers disease, was admitted with pneumonia in December to ward E3 (via more than 4hrs in A&E). Evidently scared, he was roughly stripped of clothes in front of my mother and shown no respect or dignity The mental health team were not contacted, despite ourselves and the dementia matron requesting it and despite repeated requests from myself and my elderly mother we did not get to meet a consultant or kept informed as to my father's condition. His dementia nutrition needs and evident delirium were ignored and he lost weight alarmingly which we kept raising with ward staff. My mother felt bullied by a social worker when my father was declared fit and a doctor saying -what is that man still doing here, we need the beds. My father then contracted secondary pneumonia, our requests for a meeting with a multidisciplinary team ignored once more and eventually we were persuaded to agree to my father being transferred to an intermediate care facility before being medically stable as ""that was the only way they could establish his baseline needs and carry out the needs assessment"". Care at the intermediate facility was poor, my father was once more rushed to A&E and endured more than 5hrs there before being admitted to ward B6 via a period in AMU. Again we started the fight re nutrition, it was obvious my father was declining and he had suffered acute delirium, all mobility gone. We finally had a multidisciplinary meeting after I wrote to every head of service possible. The meeting took place, no mention of prognosis was made. My father died a week later. I rang on the day of his death for an update and was told he was declining but that it was not urgent for me to visit, that evening I received a call and was told decline but still not that he was dying until I asked directly. We rushed to the hospital only to see that my poor, dear, wonderful father had died without his family and wife of over 50 years. He died in the middle of a busy ward. We had to knock on the ward doors for admission. So heartbroken that he was not given the appropriate care and dignity when he needed it the most.",1

My pain disappeared and I was discharged in the afternoon. Unfortunately this morning it all recurred and once again in severe pain I was taken to the WHH. I was told that I would be given pain relief and I waited and waited and waited, all this time in awful pain. Three times I asked for pain relief and the last time I was told that they were going to give me Volterol suppositories and I said I couldn't have them as I was told countless times that due to a medication I take I could not take Volterol. Another hour went by when the sister was trying to find a consultant but not once did anyone ask how I was even though it was obvious I was in severe pain. In the end I was so upset and distressed that I walked out. I felt it was barbaric to let someone continue in awful pain. I was told that morphine was not used for kidney stones......well, I wonder why I was given it yesterday.. I don't slag off the NHS st all, I worked in this hospital for more or less20 years and would never have left a patient in so much pain.",1

As I read the pages of information the night before I saw (on page 3) that if my appointment had not been arranged by telephone I needed to email to say I was attending. It would seem more logical to put that paragraph right after the details of the appointment, wouldn't it? I only saw it by chance as none of the travel details were needed by me. I also have to mention how irritating it is to have a whole sheet of A4 with only 5 lines on it. What a waste of paper.",0

I followed the ambulance there, he arrived around 3.30 on Saturday afternoon by 9.30pm he was still in A/E waiting to see a heart doctor, The corridor had trolleys lined up waiting for a cubicle. When the heart doctor finally arrived the she was very good and gave my husband the medication required and confirmed he'd a heart attack, before that he was left there as if he had a minor injury with no actual care, he is still waiting for a bed in the heart ward 24hours later, he has no idea when he will be able to have a bed never mind an angiogram, he was told there are 15 people waiting for a bed. We are both frightened, have no idea when he will be treated properly. When I went to see my husband today he was so panicked his condition was awful his chest was aching more due to anxiety, the nurses had just left him, I took him out to a side room, he got some air and felt better. What kind of place is this, I have read all the wonderful reviews above and feel really let down. My husband is a middle aged man he doesn't smoke or drink, surely treatment for him or anyone should be more urgent than this. He has had a heart attack and has chest pains, as I write this and he is still in a ward that can't give him the treatment he urgently requires.

521026,"my elderly relative aged 80 was recently admitted into Purley 1, Bay 3 after becoming severely ill with several gallstones and acute pancreatitis. Whilst visiting my relative I found myself doing all the actual care for her due to the nursing staff being nowhere to be seen. When on the odd occasion a nurse, HCA was found they were very unhelpful and didn't attend to the patient who was vomiting during supper time infront of the other patients whilst they were trying to eat their supper. When the Sister was approached at the nurses desk she didn't even look up and there was no eye contact. The way she spoke was very rude and unwelcoming. One HCA was very rude and argumentative in front of the patient and another relative of mine. I am shocked and disgusted at the level of care from this ward and whilst my relative is still in there I shall be closely monitoring all aspects of care until she receives the level of care that she deserves",1

They checked in on me throughout the procedure to check I was ok, and were professional and very competent.

533101,I was called by the urology department for an appointment with my consultant. I was sent a text reminding me of the appointment and the cost to the NHS of failing to attend (c£160). I took the latest appointment available so that I could take the least amount of time off work. From my office to the hospital is 1 hour 20 mins. I arrived on time. I then waited 45 minutes. My consultation lasted 3 minutes: have I received a letter? No. I then have a journey back to my home of over an hour. That's just under three and a half hours to answer a question that could have been asked in a 30-second phone call or very short email. It's inefficient and ineffective to operate like this. Such appointments create stress and worry in some patients. I now have to make up the lost hours with my employer. Let's eliminate this waste and help to make the NHS more efficient for all.,0

I was very impressed with the fact that the staff managed to keep smiling in spite of his aggressive behaviour. The on;y problem we encountered was that there was an initial shortage of staff to manage such a challenging patient, which, as his hospital visit was unplanned, is to be expected, especially in the current NHS.

They demonstrated skills of professionalism without emotional detatchment and treated my nan with dignity throughout her stay, despite her challenging behaviour due to her condition. We would like to say a massive thank you. We are extremely grateful.",0
536452,"Hi I recently attended Tameside hospital for an appointment. The service was good (i am not complaining). What i am interested in is the provision of appointments via the post. At no point did any one collect my email address to arrange an appointment. Sending appointments via the post is a cost to the NHS when resources are limited. It has an impact to our environmental footprint, its slower and the trace-ability is limited unless extra is paid for recorded delivery. I would like to speak to someone to understand better why technology is not being exploited better. Surely there are obligations to the tax payer and the environment? thanks",0
536542,"My Dad was admitted by ambulance to A&E on the 17th March 2018. He was transferred to AMU where he stayed until the following day when he was moved onto Ward 9 where sadly he died the same day. I can honestly say the care and the kindness he received was amazing. He was 92 years old and unlikely to recover and the Doctors explained this to me with honesty and sensitivity. The paramedic who was with us in minutes, the ambulance crew, the staff in A&E and in AMU treated Dad with kindness and respect and his dignity was preserved until the end. He was only on Ward 9 for a few hours but a nurse had to make the call to tell me he had died. Again she was very kind and caring. The weather was dreadful with snow blizzards and awful driving conditions but the staff were still there through the night caring for patients like my Dad. The staff do such a difficult job in an NHS that is sadly undervalued by the Government.",0
536803,"I went for an ultrasound scan this morning at the L&D and was very impressed by the efficiency and level of care I experienced. Staff were friendly and helpful, the building, although not new, was very clean and tidy. I arrived a bit early and was able to check in using the computer system which worked well. I was seen very close to my appointment time by a friendly sonographer who explained the process clearly and put me at ease. I was out and back in the car in less than 40 mins. The only down side was the £3 it cost me for parking! Our hospitals seem to get such bad coverage in the press at the moment so I just wanted to say thanks to the staff at the L&D and highlight the fact that some parts of our NHS work very well and provide great service.",0
537017,Appointment for July cancelled to December want to phone up appointments to cancel no one answers the phone 4 times now for different appointments and you can't get through yet have the nerve to write on letter if you do not attend it costs 167 pound well if you don't answer the phone what do you expect !!!

538467,"My chemo sequence continues, and the service remains excellent. Last 3 visits to Lister Hospital were: Tuesday 29 May to Macmillan Cancer Centre for out-patient appointment; Thursday 31 May to Pathology for blood test; and Tuesday 05 June to Macmillan again for the chemotherapy session (my 3rd). Waiting times were low and staff (from Main Entrance Volunteers at Main Entrance; from Macmillan Reception staff behind counter & Volunteer with tea trolley, to Doctor & Research Nurse, and onto Chemo Suite staff, and in between at Pathology Reception Staff and Nurse) were consistently professional & helpful. Thanks again.",0
539435,"The service provided has been first class. This started with my consultation meeting after which I was immediately assessed for my forthcoming hip operation. This is a very efficient way of working and saves an additional journey. The ‘hip education session was superb and enabled me to have a clear understanding of the process before, during and after the operation. The two staff involved were very understanding and made time to respond to my individual questions. The overall experience including the check in at reception and contact with consultant's medical secretaries demonstrated an organisation committed to excellent patient care. Thankyou. Ps two members of staff from OT deserve recognition for their excellent hip education session!!",0
539483,"Over the later years of his life my elderly stepfather had several trips in an ambulance as he was less able to manage his diabetes and his general health worsened. He was always treated with kindness and respect even though he sometimes had a demanding head on him and as such could be a little challenging. Also the paramedics and A&E staff who treated him took time and care to look after my elderly mother until I could get to my parents house or the hospital. At the end of May my stepfather has had his final trip in an ambulance, but that's no reflection on the care and treatment he received,",0
539552,I went to A&E for a recurrent condition that causes very severe stomach pain. Waited 30 mins before being seen by the triage nurse who took me inside immediately as she recognised the seriousness of my condition. After waiting 45 mins I was taken to a bay and given a trolley to lie on. My complaint is that I waited 21/2 hours screaming in pain before a doctor came to see me. Nobody took notice that I was somebody screaming in pain and needed urgent attention. I was then given the pain killers to end this pain,1
540126,"I have visited the hospital on many occasions over the last 5 years and always found the staff to be friendly and helpful on each occasion. Blood tests are dealt with quickly and n a friendly efficient manner. The Hearing department offer a great service and explain everything clearly when fitting your device, with a good follow up service. X-rays are quickly attended to with little waiting and results passed to your doctor quickly. My wife and I have found the service to be excellent here and the cafe is good as well.",0
540673,Waited ages in the phone queue. I called to speak to someone in the Musculoskeletal team for referral appointment check. Barts - 0208 223 8868 - was only able to leave a voicemail - 12-6-2018 @ 1520 I called 0208 223 8859 – it was ringing for about 2 minutes no response. Prior to this I waited 17 minutes with the phone ringing but no answer when I called 0207 377 7000 and was put through to Musculoskeletal team This is typical of the poor service I receive. Ridiculous that I can't even speak to someone - tons of people want jobs. Just employ more people.,0
540560,"Unfortunately both my husband and I have spent more time at Addenbrookes than we would like over last 2/3 weeks. The call handlers at 111 and all the staff at Addenbrookes have been superb. Friendly, informative voices via ‘phone, friendly, empathetic, informative staff at ALL levels in A/E and wards. Yes, you need to be patient but...... you have access to resources it would take months to access by a GP referral (I must stress that all three visits were all emergencies identified by 111 in the first instance).

541600,Whilst on holiday our mother was taken ill.She was taken to Aintree hospital with chronic Pancreatitus and developed many complications.So severe was the illness that she remained there for two months.Our own local specialist hospital in Birmingham refusing continuously to accept us for transfer.Mom was moved around the hospital but was looked after on ward Two major trauma.The staff wete unbelievable.Kindness and care of great magnitude was shown to our mother.When it became life threatening at the end of the second month moms consultant went beyond what was expected to help her get transferred home.She has since been operated on and is now home.Without his kindness this couldnt have happened.We will never be able to thank him enough and all the staff in ward 2.A thank you to Aintree hospital for keeping her alive.long enough to get treatment.God bless you all.,0
541749,I attended the royal London hospital for a ERCP which involved having a camera down my throat. During the procedure there was some haemorrhaging that was controlled with adrenaline injections. After the procedure in the recovery ward I complained to staff about my pain and swelling that was ignored and I was told it was normal. After being told that my friend came to collect me and told me I looked too unwell to come home. The staff insisted I was well enough to go home. During my journey home I felt extremely unwell and when I got home I became delerious and was unable to walk. I endured a night of terrible sickness feeling like I was dying. Ambulance was called and I was taken to another hospital. When I arrived at hospital after scans I was told that I had a perforated bile duct and sepsis caused by the Royal London Hospital. I was told by doctors this was very serious and they may have to surgically cut open my abdomen for a wash out. The doctors told me I should of never been discharged from the Royal London Hospital when I did. I spent 4 weeks in hospital with sepsis and pleural effusion. I was unable to eat for 3 weeks and had to have a drain out through my abdomen and suffered terribly during that time. I was unable to return to full duties at work for nearly 6 months. I still cannot believe I was discharged from Royal London Hospital In that condition without being seen by a doctor. They very nearly ended my life and my three children would of been without a father. I was never told of the risks of this procedure and If was I would of never went ahead with it. All I got from them was a pathetic apology stating that I should of been seen by a doctor before discharge. I had to fight with all my mental strength to get this and I only got it when the ombudsman got involved. I felt like the apology showed no empathy and that the hospital could not care less about me.,1
541719,"After my mother went into hospital suddenly, her ex-boyfriend lied to hospital staff that he was her partner and her next of kin. She had only recently managed to have the strength to leave an emotionally and physically abusive relationship with this man. He gave permission for my mother to be taken off life support and he attempted to register the death so he could have the body cremated. All of this took place without her children or any of her family even knowing that she had died. In the six weeks since then her family have been trying to find out how she died, why she died, and what day she died. The hospital have been impossible to get in touch with and have not offered any information at all. I am not blaming them for believing this man when he lied about being next of kin, but I am shocked that from our experience, any Tom Dick or Harry can saunter through the doors with a dying person, lie that they're next of kin, and be given authority to make decisions about life support and to burn the body without the person's family or the police even knowing about the death. I have been attempting to contact Northwick Park PALS for over two months and have left dozens of voicemails and sent dozens of emails, and have not had a single response. Only once was I able to get through on the phone (normally it goes straight to voicemail) and the person I spoke to told me they would speak to a manager and phone me back within an hour, that was two weeks ago and I am still waiting ",1

542998,"I have been to XRays, the phlebotomy service and physiotherapy and they have all been fine. 2 suggestions: 1. Mobile MRI scanner GPs cannot currently book MRI scans in Brighton whereas in other parts of the county, this is normal. For example, at the Queen Victoria Hospital in Sussex, it says ""GPs can refer patients directly to QVH for imaging tests, including CT and MRI (which has a wait of no more than 3-4 weeks)."" https://www.qvh.nhs.uk/our-services/support-services/diagnostics/ Please could the MRI scanner be made available for GPs to book. A permanent primary care MRI scanner bookable by GPs in either the Hove Polyclinic, Brighton General or Southlands hospital would be very welcome. 2. primary care physiotherapy There is currently no primary care physiotherapy service in Brighton and it would be a cost saving to have physiotherapists rather than GPs doing initial assessments of MSK injuries; they also are more skilled at this than GPs. Perhaps the Hove Polyclinic physiotherapy department could operate a physiotherapy assessment directly bookable online by patients - short appointments of say 10 minutes that operate alongside their treatment sessions.",0
543281,"First of all, the treatments and services I received were always good to excellent with one exception some years ago. However, what I am asked to comment on is this survey request sent to one after almost every hospital appointment: ""Hello. The staff at United Lincs Hospital who looked after you recently would benefit from your feedback. How likely are you to recommend our Outpatient Department to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment? Reply with 1 Extremely likely, 2 Likely, 3 Neither likely nor unlikely, 4 Unlikely, 5 Extremely unlikely or 6 Don't know. Your feedback is anonymous and important to us. All replies are free. Reply STOP to opt out. Thank you."" Previously I was answering with 1. This time I decided to go for 5. After all, I don't recommend hospitals. Now, they came back to me asking: ""We're sorry the service wasn't up to standard. What were the worst aspects of the service?"" I can't see where I said anything about bad service received. I only said I will not recommend this for anyone. What is the point of a survey when the answers are interpreted absolutely wrong? A total waste of time and money! How about not to underestimate the intelligence level of participants and do a two or three question questionnaire with the same 1 best - 5 worst, 6 no answer values. A: Service Quality B: waiting time to get the appointment C: waiting time in the hospital My response for the last visit: 142",0

He has waited since February to see a surgeon who today totally dismissed his ill health and told him that he would not consider operating or offer any help. Unfortunately one particular doctor you have left a teenager utterly devastated, his ill health has a terrible impact on his quality of life and your dismissive attitude is appalling. He asked if I was allowed to join him in the consulting room to be told time had ""run out"". Such poor care of a young person. Our family have lost all faith in the RBH, we have had a unwell teenager for over two years that can not see any point in the future when he will feel well again.

Three particular comments: grateful to the nurse who explained to the waiting room at large at one point about a bit of a hold-up (so we knew the score, and we knew the reason). Second, thanks to the cleaners, who appear among other things to keep the toilets spotless. And third, for the first time, appreciated the volunteer therapist who if you wish briefly applies touch to relax you (worked both for me and my wife).",0
544963,My father passed away on father's day ward A9 he was in a room with four beds as family members arrived they had no privacy as there were other patient in the room who had family members visiting due to being Father's Day and we all were very upset and heart broken but it made us feel even more traumatise due to my father not being give the respect and family given private space to grief for the loss. I have never witnessed this kind disrespect to deceased person or family members we were put on display for others to watch us grief. When questioned to why we were not informed about what medical illness my father suffered as we kept asking over the days he was at hospital we were told sorry it must have been communication breakdown we were never told that my father suffered a silence heart attack and had pneumonia which took his life just because he was old they ignored him. I do not live in Peterborough and rang few times to ask how he was and the person who was taking care of him kept saying he is fine he has a little to eat etc even though I informed that I do not live in Peterborough and if my father is serious please let me know so i can rearrange work and visit him but they said no he is fine and than I find out that he was not well had suffered a silent heart-attack and had pneumonia why was this not told to the family members and on the day my father passed away I asked the person who was looking after him during the night he told us he was not well last night why was family not informed the hospital has taken away our chance to spend some final hours with our father. We left our father in the care of hospital but they truly showed my father no respect just because he was old or family members any respect by leaving him in a room with other patient and thier family members looking at us. My mother/sister are devastated as they only lives round 7 mins from the hospital and they could have rang them so they could have gone to hospital to be with him in his last time. The hospital wanted no one to come out of visiting hours but when someone is going to die they should not take the chance away from family members to be with their loved ones my family will live in regrate for the rest of our lives as we were not there with our father and he had to die all alone this will haunt us for ever. I am going to write a letter of complaint as what my family went through I do not wish that to happen to anyone else the staff need to make sure the communication break down does not happens to anyone else and they need to show respect to grieving family and respect to the person who dies by giving them private room to grief not leave them in public eye so everyone can see them. The treatment my father recieved and us is unacceptable and wrong. My father was shown no dignity or us.,1

548833,Attended A & E for urgent psychiatric services for my sister. Had to leave as we were ignored after registering and my sister was getting even more mentally distressed than she had been at home. Eventually had to call an ambulance who brought us back and after a brief chat to the doctor we were told to sit and wait for hours which caused my sister further distress. I can honestly say I've never seen a hospital take mental health issues so lightly and be as dismissive. We went without days of sleep and had to keep somebody who had been self harming and having suicidal thoughts to stay at the hospital and wait for hours for somebody to even acknowledge the severity of the situation. No wonder people go without help for mental health issues when it isn't taken seriously.,1

After a while this happened and was told he would be kept in overnight. He was transferred to a side ward eventually, after a long wait in a chair in a great deal of pain. Once in a bed he was given pain killers and antibiotics and was told he needed to be nil by mouth. It was later that a nurse asked him if he wanted food, to which I (his mum) had to remind them he was nil by mouth and then later he was going to be given someone else's medication until I pointed out that the date of birth read out was not my sons. Whilst he was there he had blood tests, but no reason was given for that nor was he given the results.

I felt confident after this. Then on to the Pre Op palace we're every single member of staff was super friendly and again very informative, my waiting time was just under 15 minutes which again is not a long time to wait.

My mother had treatment here and was admitted several times before she passed away from lung cancer.

They lost her personal items, gave her food she was allergic too, even though they were informed on many occasions. She fell when they were aware she was infirm.

We had four days on the ward and the consultants, midwives, trainees and other staff were incredible. They have provided our family with the best possible start and I couldn't be happier with the care we received. The NHS do an amazing job and the best part of the NHS is the people who work there, you are amazing. Thank you so much for all of your help and support. The community midwives and health care visitors have also been fabulous - so impressed with the 24 hour support line that you can ring, so valued and important for first time mums.

557079,I got taken to Broomfield by two lovely paramedics on Wednesday night. They were kind caring and knew about my disorder despite my GP not having a clue. Obviously nobody wants to be waiting in A&E but once I saw the doctor he knew what was going on I was treated with kindness and understanding shame about my GP though. Wonderful people doing a difficult job......cant fault their care. A big massive thank you for knowing what Trigeminal Neuralgia is suffering for 8 months still suffering but know someone understood what I have been dealing with. Doctor I saw was brilliant he dimmed the lights not to hurt me due to this awful disease. Cant thank them enough due for a pay rise me thinks all of them,0
557100,"Dept of Endoscopy Reception- very efficient, forms completed Introduction to treatment-very efficient, more forms and checks completed Treament-well delivered by professionals Post treatment- very good, explanations given Pharmacy- a nightmare! Poorly setup, given a number but called by name, no idea how long the wait would be other than a notice saying it could be 60mins. Why cant all the paperwork be linked, computerised and then the prescription emailed to a local pharmacy (if appropriate medication held by them?). Why dont they use sms messaging to advise you when your prescription is available?",0
557267,"Dear Senior Management Team, This is for the excellent service being provided in the Bermondsey Centre. I visit this clinic twice a week for phototherapy treatment. The Nurses over there are quite friendly, informative and very patient. They are ably supported by the Administrative Team, who complements the Nurses' help with the latter's timely service. The entire team competes with each other in providing a smiling customer service. Though, as a patient, it is not a happy experience visiting a hospital, they make the experience a less painful one. Each one of them provides personal care and attention to each and every patient, making sure that the latter's problems/conditions are specially reviewed in each and every case. They also make sure that the surroundings are kept spic and span. Equally, the administrative team members help us in all the supporting matters like booking appointments etc., In short, the services provided are commendable and they, as a team, are a role model and I can confidently say that they represent a sample of the noble services being provided by the entire hospital unit. If possible, kindly pass on my special thanks to each and every member listed above. 1. If there is any occasion, in which I can talk about their service, in person, I would be more than happy to do so. 2. If you want to use my comments in any of the posters/leaflets, please feel free to do so. I am willing to share my picture. 3. With the wonderful service I receive, I very much want to be a part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust - if possible. I have an MBA in Financial Management and extensive experience as a Finance Manager. Kindly let me know if I can play a part in your smooth running of the Finance Team. Once again, thank you one and all for the fabulous services being provided on a day-to-day basis. Wishing the good services to continue for ever. With Kind Regards, Lalitha Thiagarajan",0
569412,"I have had the unfortunate responsibility to visit this hospital on a number of occasions with family members and before I continue these arent one off visits this is about ongoing ""care"". Firstly there is my friend who was intimidated and threatened by a porter in the middle of the night. Who was sweetness and light to her until he realised she was married then made her life hell. Then there is my partner who had his mental health appointment cancelled with no letter or phone call. Then my sister who was treated appallingly by a nurse who had already made her own opinion of her before even treating her. It is a shambles and it makes me feel physically ill to think my loved ones are under the care of such a mess of a hospital. I am appalled and frankly terrified think I will ever need care from this horrendous place",1

As a spinal injury patient going in to the London was rather traumatic for me, I felt no one understood me. As sick as I was I was ready to discharge myself. Until i was lucky enough to come across a nurse who specialised in patients with spinal injuries. She turned my whole experience I was so impressed by her level of care and professionalism, I was in awe. I finally felt safe as no matter how hard I tried to explain the difficulties I was having, the London is a trauma hospital no one seemed to know how to treat me, then this nurse came and I just felt so safe in her hands, she took charge she knew everything about spinal patients the dangers I was facing that medical doctors where unaware of, she saved me. Even though I was being treated for one thing the medical doctors treated, I was getting sick from other spinal neglect that the medics were unaware of. As they are not fully aware of the full danger of a spinal injury. I was so ill and this nurse saved me.",1

Each stage was done efficiently, so the whole thing was quicker than expected. Every member of the team was professional, did their bit effectively & in a friendly way. Each step was explained , which I found helpful & reassuring. I felt I was given time to ask any questions & was treated with dignity throughout.

Every staff member in every department were motivated, caring, compassionate and highly professional (ED / X-Ray / Plaster Room / Ward 33 / Theatres / Pain Management). The environment was very clean (with enthusiastic, interactive domestic support staff) and well maintained. The food was diverse in terms of choice, regular, tasty and piping hot at point of delivery.

All staff who I encountered ( at all levels) were amiable, helpful and a credit to their profession and to the Hospital as a whole. IN particular I would like to thank a particular Consultant for his Expert Care and for the professional support of a particular Nurse and another member of staff.

Don't know how invidious it is to mention especially the nurses who have been extremely kindly. Only to add one possible minor criticism, that of the plumbing: compare the mixer tap in the patient toilet in the Chemo Suite which works well (start cold, and then turn tap to get hotter, as per symbol on top) with that of the mixer tap in the patient toilet in the Waiting Area of the Macmillan Cancer Centre which at least for me has a flaw (starts immediately on hot, despite the same symbol).

A much more efficient service, whereby all the tests are administered by nurses, the results sent to doctors at the hospital and then only called back to see the doctor if necessary. All tests done in under 1.5 hours, whereas sometimes the same visit to the hospital can take 3 hours! Friendly staff, and a clean environment. I have to say the waiting room was so lovely & relaxed, very quiet, with air con to keep it cool. I LOVED the fact that there was no radio/tv, just peace & quiet. Please don't ever change this! I, for one, find a tv blasting out to be such an annoyance, so I was happy!",0

Considering I made the phone call at 9:10am I don't find this either acceptable or offering good customer care.

The rooms are cleaned daily and the food is more than palatable. I was outsourced from Charring Cross Hospital (Imperial College Health Care to North London Health Care) to CMH. Due to the Hospital not having an A&E department there is an air of calm and when a date is set for your operation you are 99% guaranteed there will be no delays are cancelations.

575053,"The hospital/trust needs to move into the 21st century and implement standard technology to save the time of both patients and clinical staff. For example today I arrived 15 minutes early for an appointment that was due to start at 15.35. The notification for this appointment was sent by post, but could have been sent by email, if these details were collected along with address and telephone details. The appointment was twenty minutes late (not a problem) and took approximately 3 minutes to complete. This appointment could have been conducted over the telephone or via a video conference e.g. Skype, which could have saved the NHS both time and money and parking charges for patients. I appreciate that clinics will over run as Consultants see a large amount of patients with a number of differing clinical needs. However, where the purpose of the appointment is to formally discharge a patient from a Consultant's list, different appointment methods should be offered for appointments that take less than five minutes to complete.",0

I telephoned at 1.25 p.m. and was asked by message to hold as all operatives were busy; and that i was No. 9 'in the queue'.

She was frightened to say anything else about other treatment she received at the hands of some staff and the staff at Heligan ward St Austell Community hospital.

581268,"Following my heart by-pass surgery I was made aware of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Programme and consequently enrolled on it to aid my recovery. I received clear and timely pre-attendance information regarding the course, which was highly reassuring. The Programme is extremely well-structured in that there is a 'Welcome' session at which everything is explained in plain English prior to the actual physiotherapy sessions, which follow over a number of weeks. Reading material is provided to support the welcome presentation. The physiotherapy sessions are again well structured and allow for individual capabilities within the overall programme. The sessions are conducted in a relaxed, but focused manner and each participant is given ample encouragement and support throughout. My own recovery programme occurred during the exceptionally hot summer of 2018 and care was taken by the staff to ensure that participants were not put at risk by the logistical constraints of the gym. The sessions allowed for a progressive build up in physical activity, and at the same time at no point did I feel pressured into doing anything which I felt was beyond my capability. What I found pleasantly surprising was that following the warm down section off the session a further Well-Being element took place, whereby participants are provided with a brief period of relaxation before departing the hospital. All of the staff were friendly, knowledgeable, considerate and above all, highly professional. I felt fully engaged in the recovery process throughout. They were all a credit to the hospital. The car parking logistics of repeat sessions were well managed and I did not encounter any problems at all. All in all, I would suggest that anybody who is recommended to attend the Programme should take up the offer, as I believe it has been highly beneficial to my own recovery. Thank you. A First Class service!!!",0

582021,"We felt that my elderly father was discharged before he was fit. We were told it was very unlikely he would last more than 24 hours on admission to hospital but he pulled round and he improved slightly but was still very frail and we were told he was very poorly. A week after admission he was sent for rehab in a step down unit which we felt was too soon but put our trust in the doctors looking after him. He rapidly declined after discharge and that same night the paramedics were called after he became unresponsive and had unstable vital signs, but on them contacting the hospital they were advised for him not to return as they said that was how he had been on discharge?? The next night paramedics were called again as he was worsening; again the same response from the hospital. We then agreed with an out of hours doctor that he was palliative and we were happy for him to be looked after in the step down unit with medications to keep him comfortable. It then came to light that his DNAR form, completed in hospital was filled out incorrectly, making it void, so it necessary for him to return to hospital where he was made ‘end of life' on arrival. We feel miffed by the whole experience, it made us feel as though he was pushed out ASAP as they needed the bed for the next ‘number' sorry patient.",1
582460,"My mother was admitted into West Middlesex Hospital at the beginning of 2017. She was admitted to Marble Hill 2 ward. She suffered a blackout at home. Whilst she was in hospital, her physical health became worse, she had pain in her stomach, her legs and feet became severely swollen, her speech became slurred and she caught a blood infection whilst at the hospital. She was vomiting dark red vomit and her stools were dark. My mother had loss of appetite and was not able to finish meals. She became less mobile whilst in hospital and relied on nurses to help get her in and out of bed. When I asked what was causing the vomiting to the nurses they said they did not know she had been vomiting as it was not written on her notes. My mother was discharged from hospital. My mother was still vomiting and she still had the blood infection. My family and I do not think my mother was well enough to be discharged. The hospital rang us in the afternoon informing that my mother was being discharged. We voiced our concerns but the nurse said my mum was still going to be discharged and that the hospital will arrange transportation later that afternoon to drop her home. The nurse informed me that my mother's medication was not ready yet so it would be dropped off later that same day. That day, my mother was dropped home at 9.30pm without any medication and without her discharge letter. My family and I think this is unacceptable to send an elderly patient home at that time of night especially without any medication. My mother is type 2 diabetic and relies on daily insulin injections. She is also on several other medications as she has heart failure, kidney problems, and mental health issues. We had no idea if any of the medication had been changed, altered or stopped as we did not have the discharge letter. The following morning, my mother's medication had still not arrived. I phoned the hospital ward and they informed me that it will be delivered later that afternoon. After I finished work that day I went round to visit my mother to make sure she had taken her medication. It had still not arrived. I phoned the hospital yet again and they promised me it would be delivered later that evening. It was not delivered that evening or night. The following day my mother's medication finally arrived. I feel that this is unacceptable for the hospital to deliver the medication 2 days after a patient is discharged knowing she is diabetic and insulin dependent. That same day my mother had another blackout, she was fitting and her blood sugar levels were very low. After examination, the A&E doctor informed us that my mother had a stomach ulcer which caused severe internal bleeding. The doctor operated and clipped the ulcer. My concerns are why this ulcer was not detected before? The following day my mother sadly passed away in the hospital. The cause of death was stated as Acute Gastrointestinal bleed by Duodenal Ulcer. My family and I are disappointed at the care provided by the nurses and doctors at the hospital.",1

Instead I would like to suggest that the appointment notification is done by a simple text message requiring an accept/decline response.

One week later and not even had the couttesy of an acknowledgement. No idea how else you are supposed to be able to contact this Department since there are limited contact details even on the GSTT web site. Appalling patient services.

Good food. **The not so Good.** Had to wait 8 days for Angiogram. No weekend working except for emergencies. **Observation.** Accepting Health & Safety and requirements in specialist medical wards is it really necessary to change all bedlinen every day? The cost must be enormous. Nobody wants to be in hospital but the staff at Treliske are excellent and I would like to give them my heartfelt thanks.,0
585625,"Went to the sex health clinic when the website said it was open but website not updated and it was closed (after I had spent £4 parking!!!). Went again today and walk in clinic is too busy to see me - what is the point! Useless service. When I told the lady I had come on Tuesday because of wrong info on website she said ""no it is correct"" as if I read the opening hours and thought oh yes its closed on Tuesdays let me take time off work and go there when it is closed and pay for parking that I don't need!!!!!!!!",0
585837,"My 3 year old granddaughter was admitted to the Rainforest ward after being diagnosed with Viral Induced Wheeze. My granddaughter was staying with me whilst her mummy was away. She became ill very quickly, within 30 minutes, and was struggling to breathe. The A&E department stabilised her before the Rainforest ward took over her care. From the moment we arrived on the ward the experience was beyond reproach. Every member of staff introduced themselves not only to me but my granddaughter also. They involved her in everything that they needed to do. They certainly put her at ease and me also, a very distressed grandmother. Nothing was too much trouble and everybody that cared for her was so friendly. I cannot thank everybody involved enough. Special thanks go to: Dr Amera and Nurse Virgil in A&E, Jenny, Mel, Chelsea and Beth, the nurses on the ward who cared for my granddaughter and the Doctors who sadly gave me their names but considering the situation I unfortunately can't remember. Thank you all for making my granddaughter well again.",0

I have always been treated with dignity and respect, and feel fully informed at all times.

This is, for me, a completely stress free environment, for which I am very appreciative. Well done and thank you to all, and keep up the excellent work.",0
586149,"During my stay on 5B North, I was extremely satisfied with the smooth and efficient running of the ward. All the staff were courteous, friendly and professional throughout my stay. I received a very high standard of nursing care from all who looked after me from student nurses right up to senior staff. During my stay I was well fed and watered with excellent food provided by the housekeeping / catering staff. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the ward, the cleaner was very efficient. This is a very well run ward and all the nursing staff are second to none. Lovely staff, great care, Thank you.",0
594977,"From the people on the front desk to the consultant, nurses, phlebotomists and cartographers everyone was kind, polite and helpful. My treatment options were explained, tests completed on-site and very quickly (a 1 minute wait for blood tests and less than 1 minute wait for x-rays).At my initial appointment I was given a steroid injection to help until the medicines started to work. At the follow up appointment the medicines were explained and more options given. I left with plenty of information leaflets and follow up appointments made. Thank you.",0
588347,. I have never come across a more arrogant doctor who made the patient feel unwelcome and unworthy. My son left the consultation feeling demoralised and hopeless. The doctor was patronising and contemptuous leaving my son feeling degraded.and demoralised. The doctor showed no compassion or understanding of my son's condition and the doctor's body language displayed boredom. The doctor displayed more interest in tidying his desk than listening to the patient. When challenged about the outcome of the consultation the doctor shrugged his shoulders - totally disinterested. As it was 5 pm I guess getting us out of the office was more important than the consultation.,0
587665,"During my first appointment to the ENT department all of the staff were extremely professional, thorough, patient and kind, which was very reassuring. On the day results were explained to me and further investigations were organised within days. My second appointment at ENT was to see another consultant and to receive and discuss the reports, which resulted in me being transferred to another department for treatment. My grateful thanks to all the staff of the ENT department for providing me with such prompt, efficient service and my first step along the 'road of recovery' Thank you.",0

We put in our registration, the machine asked for £1.50 which we paid by contactless and the machine gave us the ticket. We appealed the charge but just got back a basic ""Dear Sir/Madam your appeal has been unsuccessful"". No explanation and they did not address us personally. I will be asked the Bristol Eye Hospital if I can transfer back to them.",0

The treatment I received, both medical & personal, was excellent with nothing being too much trouble for the staff, also I couldn't fault the food with a good choice of tasty items served by helpful staff. The cleaners & the porters should also be mentioned, carrying out their work efficiently & with a smile.

The nature and needs of the service you provide inevitably leads to some waiting, and must be expected. Not a problem, so glad to get the treatment. The atmosphere was very convivial, the layout of the waiting area made that possible. I met some interesting individuals, it helped that, “we were all in the same boat”. I wish to extend my appreciation to everyone concerned. I am recovering very well. Thankyou very much.",0

Every midwife that I came into contact with, for both my check-ups and the delivery, were friendly, helpful, supportive and reassuring. The facilities at the centre were fantastic, the fact that I had my own room and my partner was able to stay with me made the experience so personal and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this facility and hope that if I have another baby that I am able to deliver at this facility.

Our special thanks go to six staff members.",0
591333,"Attempts to contact the Clinical Admin Office to cancel an operation appointment date is a nightmare. My husband has been trying to do this for the last 2 days without success. On one attempt we were 3rd in the queue and held on for an hour but during this time our number in the queue did not change and today we were 15th in the queue which progressed to 11th in 40 minutes (when the battery in our phone died!). There is no direct email contact address either. My husband is going to write to Clinical Admin to attempt to cancel his appointment as this will most probably be the most efficient way to deal with the problem of contacting the office. You need to give some thought to your telephone system of dealing with appointments in light of what you say in your appointment letters “The more notice we have, the easier it is for us to find you a more suitable date, and to find another patient who is able to fill your original appointment. Short notice cancellations cost this hospital thousands of pounds each week as we cannot always find other patients to fill empty slots at last minute.” This is not a criticism of the clinical care of the hospital only of your admin.",0

As a suggestion, would suggest that all patients are specifically asked for feedback on these items as part of their hospital release process - don't just leave it for people to find and to complete this web-site.

Excellent service from the outset by very courteous staff. My only gripe is that the car parking is expensive at £6.50 over the two hours but for the service I received, I guess that is cheap. Well done to all in A&E and thank you.",0
595160,"Hello I had an appointment at AUHT ENT department today for 10:45. It was the first time that I have visited Aintree hospital so I arrived in what I thought was a good time 10:15 I drove into the multi storey car park looking for a space but it was completely full I was following another 7 cars all looking for a space. After going round and round ,up and down for over nearly twenty minutes without finding a space I was starting to panic thinking I would miss my appointment. I left the multi storey car park and drove around the hospital estate trying to find somewhere to park. I eventually found a parking space in the short stay car park, logged in at 10:39. I was rushing to make my appointment so I didn't notice the time parameters I had to go to a pre op assessment which made my appointment longer than anticipated. When I went to pay for my parking at 12:49 I was charged £10.00. I spoke to someone via the intercom who told me I had to pay it or they couldn't let me out. I have looked at the car park charges you display on your website which are. Car Parking Charges In order to ensure we can continue to provide sufficient and accessible parking to visitors, Aintree has a charging system for parking. These charges apply to all vehicles including motorbikes: • Up to 30 minutes – free, to enable drop offs and collection • 30 minutes to 1 ½ hours - £3.00 • 1 ½ hours o 2 ½ hours - £4.00 • 2 ½ hours to 3 ½ hours - £4.50 • Over 3 ½ hours - £5.50 Nowhere does it say over £5.00 per hour. The most I should have paid is £4..00 I have the receipt to prove payment. I hope this can be resolved and the extra payment refunded I know your website advocates public transport because of parking difficulties, but I have mobility issues and I'm a blue badge holder, so using public transport is not an option.",0

The lady on X-ray reception who checked me in was very friendly and I sat expecting to perhaps have a little wait to be seen. Not the case. Was called through within 5 minutes of arriving. The radiographer was really pleasant and explained everything she was doing. Within 10 Minutes I was finished and on my way back to car park. The added bonus was that because everything was done and dusted within 30 minutes .. I had no parking fee to pay as 1st 30 minutes is free! Winner winner!!

The team are friendly and helpful and have excellent listening skills. They work with your needs rather than just often standard care and exercises.

The results for STI screening are sent to you on the same day and I would have been able to get the coil fitted in on the same day as well. Even though I arrived twenty minutes before close, I received such good service. I cannot recommend this place enough!",0
597052,I recently attended the hospital as an outpatient in the Colorectal Department. I have nothing but praise for both the surroundings and the staff. I thought the entrance was bright and cheerful - directions were excellent - and the staff outstanding. I thought booking in via computer was a very efficient method and liked the large screen giving me more information about my appointment time. The consultant I saw explained everything to me fully and I was impressed by his understanding of my needs. I have been referred for a follow up colonoscopy and have no worries at all about the procedure. Exceptional service given by exceptional staff!,0
596270,"Staff on Cambridge K seem unable to understand how to treat a dying person with respect and dignity. My relative was terminally ill and was not released home as per his wishes, ironically because doctors said it would shorten his life. He knew he was dying but wanted HIS choice. Wouldn't even transfer to a hospice. He died within 24 hrs in a ward which was exactly what he didn't want as he'd seen many others die in a ward situation and simply wanted to be home. No compassion, no caring. Some individual staff do a good job but they are few and far between. More worried about their CQC scores than treating fellow humans with respect. I hope none of them ever has to face seeing their relative treated this way as I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.",0

I've been waiting for over a month for a letter for my operation and no one is answering the calls (have called at least 29 times at different times of the day and on different days with no luck). I've been dealing with this department since May this year, I understand that the NHS is in crisis and waiting times are long but please at least train your stuff to pick up the phones or inform people that the department cannot be reached by phone, it would save everyone's time, including yours. Can someone please advise how long does it usually take to get a letter and which other ways can the department be contacted on? Thanks, K",0
598154,"First of all the Staff at East Block Day Unit were Great. What lets this Hospital down parking. Why build a Hospital without plenty of parking, on 2 days I spent over an 1 1/2 hrs each day driving in and out of car parks to find somewhere to park. Parking on the 1 day I found somewhere to park cost £14.90p, This is an Hospital ripping off patients because they have a big share of parking fees. A fair price would be £5.00 for 24 hrs. Building a large Hospital without plenty of parking for patients under the Trade Discription Act ""should be unfit for purpose""",0

601344,My wife has suspected heart failure and was referred to Basildon Hospital by her GP. During her ECG examination the nurse asked my wife to explain what her symptoms were. After explaining her symptoms the nurse said she couldn't be experiencing all of those problems implying my wife was lying. Then my wife was due to have a CT scan. Unfortunately she never received an appointment for this. The next communication was from my wifes GP asking her to make an appointment with him. When she attended her GP she was shown a letter from Basildon Hospital explaining as she had not attended her appointment for her CT scan the hospital were discharging her from their care back to her GP. I suspect this is a money saving tactic to save on finances blaming non attendance of an appointment when they don't send you an appointment to start with.,1

Terrible idea to put the mobile unit in a hospital car park but, if that is all that is available, I would suggest that 2-3 spaces are allocated to the mobile unit. The screening service itself is an amazingly efficient process (well done - total time there about 15 minutes) but this is somewhat negated by the car parking stress and the 20 minute walk from the shopping centre car park.

607570,"After an initial meeting at St.Peter's where the suitability or otherwise of the programme was discussed, I attended a six week (12 sessions) cardiac rehabilitation course and two informative educational sessions. The whole experience was excellent and very enjoyable. The staff were knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and considerate. The individual programme could be adjusted to suit the patient. There was a good ratio of staff to patients. At the first session the programme is established. Each session comprised a warm up for everyone, three (or four) circuits of activity tailored to an individual, a cool down session followed by a relaxation period. Progress is recorded in a personal booklet during each session along with regular pulse readings and occasional blood pressure readings. After the programme has been completed in full there are recommendations for continuation of cardiac exercise within the locality and general guidance to keep a healthy heart. I would recommend this programme to anyone who has had cardiac problems. It reinforces the need to exercise regularly and sensibly. It also helped me gain confidence as to what I was capable of doing and how far I could push myself",0

Upon my arrival, nobody could tell me exactly what stage we were at - the doctors were rushed off their feet and simply had no time to speak to me. My father could barely move and yet I was (eventually) told if his X-ray was clear he would be discharged. He could barely move! I felt there was an element of disregard for the elderly here and an urgency to send patients home when (like my father) they were not in any fit state to leave. Some of the staff were quite heavy handed with him even when he was screaming with pain. It was pretty abysmal to be honest.",1

I was advised to ring to book an appointment in 2 days time - I rang the centre first thing on Thursday morning and was given an appointment for Friday at 3.30pm (Yes, the following day). I couldn't believe it was so quick. When I arrived for my appointment everything was equally as quick/smooth - I arrived at 3.15pm and was seen straight away. I was back in the car park before my appointment time!!! And an added bonus the first 20 minutes are free parking. A wonderful experience all round, thankyou to everyone concerned and a Happy Christmas",0

So we had to ring the booking phone numbert to book the appointment rendering the on-line booking system useless. In addition the person my daughter spoke to had never used the on-line booking system and had no idea how it work and couldn't talk her through it. Why doesn't the NHS train it's staff ???? We still have no idea how on-line booking works. It may nor work at all. Another half baked NHS system!!!!!!!!!!!,0

612641,"I was rushed into hospital on 22nd December 2018 following severe abdominal pain and sickness. I was put into the delivery suite due to being pregnant, all the midwives that cared for me the first two nights I stayed in where no one knew what was wrong with me and kept telling me I had a stomach bug, were lovely so caring and really made me feel safe and gave me my pain relief on time and saw that I was comfortable and treated with respect. The next day I was met by 4 doctors who assured my it was a stomach bug that the intense pain I was in was gas and I could go home with buscopan. Everything in my being told me this was not the case I had never felt so poorly in my life and for fear of my unborn child being hurt I demanded to stay and have repeat bloods and more observation (as a nurse myself I may have more medical knowledge than a regular patient) next thing after repeat bloods it was very clear something was seriously wrong, my infection markers had gone through the roof and my pain was getting worse. They then had to screen me for sepsis, after telling me my observations were fine ie temperature this was due to the fact I was having IV paracetamol when I did not have that, my temp went up to 38.3 and I was not vommitting due to having anti sickness medication. After a long wait I was given an MRI scan which confirmed I had appendicitis it all went mad from there. I was sent straight to theatre to have my appendix removed. I was sent to ward 20 an experience I shall never forget my treatment here was appalling, left crying in agony in bed for hours. Only one hca showed me an ounce of compassion and kindness. Other patients on the ward were also left crying in agony for hours due to staff being to busy. It is honestly the worst most barbaric situation I have been in. I got out of that ward the next day through sheer determination as I could not spend another minute on that ward. Inhumane to say the least.",1

So much for the ""golden hour""! I have encountered the same dreadful example of treatment from the A&E receptionists before, I complained at that time about an old lady who was waiting to be collected, she was shivering with cold and I requested a blanket for her but was told that she was fine when she obviously was not.",0

I checked the Chase Farm web-site this morning to find out where I had to go and found this map http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.royalfree.nhs.uk/CFH_redevelopment/Chase_Farm_Hospital_map.pdf which shows the old hospital. I printed out the map and assumed I had to go to the blood test area marked on that map which is part of the old hospital. I arrived on foot in the dark, having walked up Ridgeway from the main road. At the entrance I bore right, as that was where I thought I was going. I saw one sign pointing left to the private hospital only, so assumed the phlebotomy was not in that direction. Eventually I walked round, past the old phlebotomy site, to the bus drop off area at the side of the site, where I found someone to give me directions. There are signs about the new hospital – but only further into the main entrance so you have to be going in the right direction to spot them. Action required 1. Please update the maps on the web-site (link above), and the link from the blood test page which does not work https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/services/services-a-z/blood-tests/book-an-adult-blood-test/{page_599}/ . 2.

The blood transfusion was successful and my son reacted well to the treatment. Special thanks to the doctor for his swift response in treating the jaundice. The accident and emergency department was extremely busy but he saw my son and took him under his care immediately without making us wait. He instinctively covered my son in a blanket and took him to the correct department to be treated immediately.

I asked them 4 times to see him a asap as so dehydrated and as I waited 5 people after after us go t seen first. I ended complaining as felt disgusted as my son nearly collapsed before they took any notice. The Dr who saw us showed no compassion and was obnoxioys. As English was not my first language I felt they ignored me and my child and didn't have the time. I actually feel the dept was quite prejudice towards me and refused an Interpreter. Luckily another person helped me out. In the end when I said I was dissatisfied with the care received they just threw me a pamphlet pals to whom to complain too and just smirked.

No further observations were performed during this 4 waiting time , they were both so uncomfortable on the chairs they were at least given blankets to sit on . My mother is also diabetic and was unable to eat or drink due to being so unwell. I am astounded that 2 very elderly people one of whom was admitted by ambulance due to the concerns of her GP regarding the severity of her condition , who also had significant co-morbidities can be left in the waiting room with no attention or regard for observing for any deterioration in her condition . Quite honestly if a person is admitted via ambulance with that degree of frailty how is it appropriate to leave them in that unsafe situation which if they were not already significantly ill they certainly will be after no care or attention for 4 hours.",1

The GP referral (Stennack Surgery) was very speedy, the staff are always good and it's always possible to see the doctor of choice. Stennack referred me to the Mermaid Centre at Treliske. The service here was very good too, consultants and nurses. I had a lumpectomy at St Michael's, Hayle in June 2015 and the service was very good. I had chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the Headlands - receiving 6 monthly injections and bone infusions (the last of which is next month). I was at at Treliske following a GP referral last week (Penzance - Rosemellyn Surgery). The letter from Treliske following the referral came only 2 days later for an investigation for possible bowel cancer. I have no complaints whatsoever. I feel I have had very good care. I do think that it is difficult to get to Treliske (I'm a resident in Penwith).

It's not difficult really - just give a little thought to what people might be looking for and make it clear and easy to find. And I see this has also been commented on before. Why no action?,0

I am use to my granddad taking his insulin. I would have been far less upset if i had been allowed to stay in the room while the doctor gave my granddad his insulin.

I feel very sad that he was then placed in MRU and then Mandarin Ward A with other patients who clearly were dementia or mentally ill patients.

This should apply to other patients also and I felt that with the staff that seemed extremely busy there was not enough one to one care either given.

I had a camera inserted into my bladder, took 10 minutes, had to go back to take a flow test, took 5 minutes. Why could this not be done at queens? It takes me 1 1/2 hours by public transport (2 buses and 1 train) to get to King George and 15 minutes 1 bus to Queens. If this was for a major op I can understand having to travel further, but for simple tests, why can I not go to our new state of the art Queens Hosp. If I had known this from the beginning I would have gone elsewhere.",0
634603,"After a stroke and fall our 97 year old relative spent some time on Barry ward . We were worried because of the terrible stories we hear about how the elderly get treated in hospital . However on visiting , although a cramped ward he could not have been given better care ! Being incontinent , frail and suffering from dementia the staff went out of their way to make sure he was spotlessly clean and comfortable at all times . The nurses joked with the patients and made them laugh . It was lovely to see . Thankyou for making him happy and treating him with such dignaty .",0
632494,"This story is about my father. He has late stage vascular dementia and recently had a bad fall and ended up in Treliske's Trauma Ward with a fractured pelvis. I was saddened at the lack of attention that was given to Dad's underlying dementia and how traumatic at a stay in hospital can be for those suffering from this terrible disease. I'm not decrying the care given by the nurses and doctors with regards to his trauma but his dementia was always seen as a secondary condition that didn't warrant much attention. Nobody talked to us about Dad's baseline condition before he had the fall - could he communicate much, how mobile was he, what medication was he on and how good was he at taking it etc. Nothing was written on the whiteboard behind his bed stating he had Dementia. One nurse arrived and announced I believe your father is deaf? No, he's not deaf - he has dementia and finds communication very difficult. My mother had to visit Dad most days for 10 days to make sure Dad took his medication as he's not good at all with taking them and without them he gets very agitated and distressed. The nurses tried but gave up very quickly when he spat them out across the room. Without my mum's care he would have been practically un-medicated for his stay and would have been suffering terribly with anxiety and hallucinations. When he was recovering the doctors would visit him on their rounds and my Mum would try to ask questions relating to his dementia and was told that he was in a Trauma Ward and that they were only there to deal with the trauma! How can you treat trauma in a dementia patient in isolation? If you ask them to raise their leg and they don't - is it because they physically can't or their dementia means they can't process the request? Dad was given an opiod patch for his pain but seemed to go downhill in his general condition as the week went on. He became very withdrawn and responsive and we started fearing the worst - that his fall had made him much worse and that he was failing. Then one afternoon he crashed and needed emergency care. It turns out his body wasn't processing the opiod well and he had basically over dosed on it. We were actually asked by a ward sister when discussing his general state - what was he like before he came in? And this is my point - they should have asked and documented his condition beforehand and then they would have known that he was in serious decline rather than assume that his declining condition was just what Dad was normally like anyway. There is so much more Treliske can do to recognise the needs of dementia patients in Trauma Wards. And it's not difficult - their stay in hospital can be made so much better by just labelling clearly those geriatric patients who have dementia and what specific issues they may need to address as well as the trauma. Document clearly their baseline condition before the trauma to help identify a decline and to not have unrealistic expectations post trauma. It would amazing if separate wards could be made available for those suffering from dementia where a calmer environment could be created - this is exactly what Leicester Royal Infirmary have done.",1
635228,The queue to get to triage was an hour long. You tell them the problem you then have to queue again to register for 30 mins. That's when the 4 hours start. So the last 1 half hours don't count towards the 4 hours waiting time. The they send you to majors light to repeat everything you told triage and booking. Then another wait to be called into the cubicles to again repeat everything. Then they do blood tests and you wait outside for 2 hours. Then called back in to actually see a doctor. Total 4 hours plus the 1 half not counted =5half hours,0
633545,"My sister died on 1 February 2019 after being diagnosed with lung cancer with metastasis to the lymph nodes spine and brain. Everything happened so quickly but my sister was coherent and sitting up in her hospice bed for many weeks before she died. Treatment offered for the spine was in the end not given despite the fact that that this was the absolute worst of her symptoms and cause of pain and discomfort, and I think should have been given much earlier, but sadly my sister was hospitalised and due to this occurring over the Christmas period nothing other than palliative care was offered. We did eventually see the oncology head early January and after learning that my sisters first biopsy had been too small to detect too much I insisted on another in order to detect any mutations which could be targeted, with the agreement of my sister of course. Her lung capacity was good according to the doctor and she had no brain tumour symptoms. He agreed to some radiation to the spine to alleviate the pain and lack of movement then at some point weeks later decided against radiotherapy which my sister was not informed of by him but a hospice doctor who was investigating why my sister had not received a date for her radiotherapy. Her final telephone messages to me were that she had absolutely no confidence in her oncology team head doctor, who I shall not name at this point in time. I believe she willed herself to die a week after that message was sent to me. All she wanted was a little extra time to spend with her sons, not to live for years, and I believe this little time could have been granted had she been afforded much better treatment.",1

633895,STILL NO USABLE WIFI!!!!!! After months of begging and many attempts to converse with the it department the hospital still cannot provide a working WiFi setup. The trust removed or in the case of new building do not provide tv under the disguise and I quote “ people use WiFi these day “ and the very thinly veiled promise that the new build will have TVs when money becomes available. The wards 10 & 11 have not had a usable WiFi for over 3 months. A inconvenience if you are in for a short stay but as I have been residing here for over 3 months is very hard when you are expected to sit and stare at a wall for over 15 hours a day !!!!

638150,"Good afternoon, I have requested a copy of the MRI scan i had on 27th February 2019. I was told that I have to go twice to the hospital, once to request it and once to collect between 9 to 4 Mon to Fri. My complaint is that I (as many, many people in London) between those hours and those days am at work. And as you can guess I do not work (or live) next door to the hospital. To have a copy of the MRI scan I would have to miss work not once but twice! I would like to know what is the difficulty of having longer reception hours including weekends? I have been to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital for visits either late in the evening and even on Sundays, so why cannot this service be provided on an extended time or on a Saturday? Even better given that we are in the era of technology, why cannot I requested online or by email and you then posted to me? I would even be happy to pay for the service. I will need copy of the MRI scan before the 30th April 2019 but I do not have the possibility to follow your silly procedure unless I miss work. Any suggestions? Looking forward to your reply.

638502,"Once you see the Consultant, the service is 5 star however actually getting to see the Consultant or arrange an appointment with the Dental Services is impossible. Advice is to arrange your follow-up appointment when you finish seeing the Consultant however the staff on the Reception absolutely refuse to do this and are very rude in the process. You are told you will be sent an appointment letter in time for your planned review e.g. 3 months. On every occasion I have not received the appointment and have to call repeatedly without success. An appointment letter is eventually recieved which turns out to be months later than you are to be seen. This occasion an appointment should have been in January 2019 however no appointment received and as we are not allowed to be given direct contact numbers, you try to call and are passed around. Having left multiple messages over the past month, I now receive a letter telling me I will be referred back to my GP as you cannot contact me.

700109,My Mum has been in the Ribblesdale ward for 6 weeks before being transferred to Blackburn hospital. She has been treated awfully with no support. She has spinal cord cancer is unable to walk. She was made to feel a nuisance when asking for help with toileting. She rang us constantly distressed saying she was not being treated compassionately. We felt anxious and helpless leaving her there unattended every night. As a family we were not offered any support or informed about care plans or her treatment. Every day a junior Dr or a nursing assistant offered a different opinion on my mum's condition or treatment. My Mum has been left traumatized.

639992,"My brother was attacked and after sustaining a serious head injury we went to A&E. We saw the triage nurse fairly quickly and was assured he was an urgent case. It all went down hill from here. We waited 2 hours to see a doctor and was promised paracetamol, this never arrived. He was visibly concussed and was in agony with a potential fractured leg. We eventually saw the dr and had a ct scan and X-ray. At this point, I was happy with the care but then we just waited and waited and despite my brother being in substantial pain, we were told to sit in a corridor with no expectation of what was happening. He is autistic and was seriously agitated by the now 5 hour wait. The nurses we saw were short and annoyed with us for querying progress and it was just a bad experience all round. People were coming in and being treated and leaving and we hadn't even had any results. We arrived on a quiet morning, so busyness can't be blamed, and given my brother had sustained a serious assault, a little compassion and care wouldn't have gone a miss",1

645683,"My father was not treated at all well by some of the employees in the CDU dept when he was admitted a few weeks ago. When we visited, we were told that his condition had cleared therefore he hadn't been treated since his admission. It was obvious to us this was because they wanted to discharge him immediately but believed he was not well enough to come home. We in fact found evidence that his condition hadn't cleared (probably because he had received no treatment at all!) I had to give a soiled gown and pillow case to the nurse who took them reluctantly. Two different nurses came over to us to discuss discharge details while we were visiting as my elderly parents were becoming agitated but they wouldn't leave us in peace. Eventually I decided to leave . The staff I encountered that night were not very pleasant in their attitudes and it made our father's stay uncomfortable. Staff members thought it was appropriate to make personal comments about us to our parents after we left.The incessant calls when my sister and I were teaching were also unhelpful. Thankfully my father was sent to another ward where he was treated with respect and dignity. They understood that the decision regarding discharging our father was down to social services rather than his family members. He has now had two bad experiences in this same department and we really hope it's his last. The one star is for the staff in palm ward and the paramedics who were kind and caring in their manner.",1

Nowhere on the card with the appointment time I was given does it say to go back to the reception desk! So I assumed I was booked in and waiting my name to be called out. It said there was a wait of 90 minutes to be seen so happily accepted to wait, I understand the business. Only did it come up to 90 minutes did the receptionist say I was not been booked in yet and offered me another time of 6pm! To sit there for 2 hours (in plain site) to then be told I wasn't booked in was extremely frustrating. I do think on the appointment card they need to say please go back to the reception desk as you are not booked in to make it crystal clear. When offered a time in an hour and you have given your details, you would assume you were on some list. Not the best really.",0
650557,"My husband was taken to A&E with chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations. On arrival he was seen promptly due to the nature of the visit and received an ecg straight away which showed he was in fast AF, this is a new diagnosis which he was unaware he had. Bloods were taken and he was moved from triage into a cubicle, this was just after 10am. The nurse hooked him up to a heart monitor and said they would keep an eye on him. Approximately 4 and half hours later after complaining that he was still waiting to see a doctor, he was seen by an A&E doctor that examined him and agreed that he was in AF and needed to be seen by the medics, I asked when and he said they would be down later. This was approx 14.25. My husband suffers with mental health issues and was becoming increasingly anxious, as you will know this can only make his palpitations worse. I explained to the nurse some time after that he was going outside for cigarette as his anxiety was increasing. Whilst outside my daughter explained the extent of my husbands mental health issues and she assured her that this would be forwarded onto the medics and they would make him a priority (which someone in AF should already be) At approx 16.30, 6 and half hours after arriving medics arrived in A&E and then left without seeing my husband. As you can imagine this infuriated me. I went and spoke to the nurse and informed them that I found this totally acceptable sub standard care, my husband had been in that cubicle over 6 hours no one had checked the monitor even when it was alarming at his heart rate of 165, and they had not once been in to do his observations. To which they said they'd do them now, I said no because he is asleep and if he wakes and realises the doctors have gone he will walk out. With this my husband woke and said he was leaving and went outside, I followed him and bought him back into the department. Whilst we were off the department the nurse said to my daughter they'd have to document that they have been unable to do his obs as he is not here. He was off the department less than 5 minutes, the nurse had not done his observations since he was in the cubicle almost 7 hours at this point. The nurse also told us that A&E doctors were blaming the medics and the medics were blaming A&E doctors for the fact he was still waiting. Finally at about 18.30 a medic arrived who examined him again and although agreed with the AF diagnosis said that they thought the pains my husband had previously experienced days before were not heart related but an anxiety attack. I do not believe my husband had a anxiety attack at all as my daughter is a Nurse as she treated his chest pain with Aspirin and monitored his vital signs at home. The medic then stated that they would keep him over night to give medications to control his heart and to monitor him, why these medications had not been given during the 8 hours before and monitored through the day is beyond me, instead they left us in limbo. The medic then stated that they would still have to speak to their senior first to agree a plan and the senior would need to see him first. I asked when will this senior be coming and the medic stated they couldn't say for sure as the senior was busy and would see the more urgent patients first and that it could be a few hours. With this my husband said he was leaving, he is not good in confined spaces and all the messing about and lack of care had increased his anxiety to the point of fight or flight, and he could not mentally handle staying any longer. The nurse then asked him to sign a refusal of treatment form which I explained he would not be signing as he was not refusing treatment he was refusing to wait any longer, my husband had been left unattended for hours whilst in fast AF and had he had a heart attack or gone into heart failure they wouldn't have known. I have never experienced such a lack in basic care in a hospital. My husband is home now still in discomfort and unmedicated for his fast AF but refusing to go back to A&E in fear that this experience would be repeated. I feel frightened my husband will die",1

653442,The system in the pathology unit is non progressive. In other hospitals there is an automated system where pick a generated nos and wait till your nos flashes on the screen to see a staff that will attend to you but here you have to give your blood request form to a secretary who will enter it and then the phlebotomist will come out to pick the forms and shout out names because of the crowd. I can't believe this is happening in 2019. Please move forward and improve your services. They are also understaffed. Not good experience,0
651455,"I was recently brought by ambulance to Basildon Hospital having had a suspected stroke after falling at home. The care and constant monitoring I received in casualty was first class. I was admitted to Pasteur Ward in the early hours where I was met by a Doctor who instigated every test possible it seemed. I continued to have consistently good care until I was discharged two days later. The nurses, doctors and all the auxiliary staff were so kind and professional despite the fact they are so busy. I have nothing but praise to give Basildon Hospital and their care of me when I needed it.",0
652816,"Hello, I attended for a CT Scan at the beginning of March 2019 and it is now 30 April 2019. After 4 weeks, I started calling on a weekly basis for my results or information as to when I was likely to receive a letter detailing my results. I have spoken to a different person on each occasion, each one promising to contact the relevant person/persons responsible. As I have heard nothing, I am at a loss as to what to do next, hence this email. I would be extremely grateful if someone could contact me.",0
653079,A big shout of thanks to staff at Minor Injuries Unit - Stamford and Rutland Hospital - NHS for rapid treatment of my granddaughter this afternoon. A very pleasant and helpful lady on main reception took our details and we were lucky to get straight in to see a lovely nurse-practitioner. Straight into X ray - no queue. Walk back to nurse - X ray up and on screen. Broken finger sorted and we were on our way. Everybody extremely friendly and helpful and professional (including staff on the initial 111 call). Thank you.,0

653627,"In Urgent Care dept. no clearly communicated procedure in place. Just left to sit in a stuffy and dirty waiting room. Lots of people sitting in front of a computer screen though but seem unable to communicate any information over waiting time. Apparently reception take very minimal information which then goes to a host of nurses and doctors who then make a decision on priority based on minimal info received. Just smacks of a ""can't be bothered"" approach to communication and a lack robust strategic management of an assessment procedure. Generally a wait is expected but at least have a clear system and communicate this to all as a basic courtesy.",0
653913,"I visited the Urgent Care unit dept at 8pm on Sat 4th May with a hand injury and have to say I was very impressed with how efficient and professional everyone was. I saw the receptionist and was triaged within 30 mins, sent for x-ray, injury diagnosed, finger in splint and referral to Plastics team all completed within 1 hour. The most impressive part was the staff. Finishing a 12 hour shift, the gentleman was still very friendly, warm and kind explaining everything and next steps. Great service - keep up the good work!",0
657975,"The NHS gets so much negative publicity. But so many of us get excellent service from a really stretched service, and we don't publicise this. I want to praise St Thomas A and E, and in particular the role the Rapid Response Team plays in its success Over the years [I am 84] I have on various occasions had experience of A and E, for family, friends and on occasions myself. It was in the past seldom a pleasant experience. In the last few years things have been transformed, showing practical lateral thinking and planning to create a system which works. One result is the Rapid Response Team which more than lives up to its name. The multidisciplinary team, set up to reduce admissions and readmissions, does so in an entirely user friendly and flexible way. I have twice benefitted from their service, meaning I could go home knowing I was supported in the ways I needed and with rehabilitation. To mention just two aspects of it – the flexibility in providing a service at a time suitable for me the patient, and the telephone call before to check the time is convenient. I realise that I am extraordinarily lucky to be the recipient of its services. Everyone I talk to about it wish that such a service were available in their area. So I want to thank everyone behind the thinking and design of all aspects of A and E at St Thomas, and the staff of all disciplines who do their jobs so professionally, and helpfully. By the way I would be very interested to know the statistics on the effects on rates of admission and readmission.",0
657932,"This was a 5 star service until the system changed very recently. I have AMD and attend monthly for scans/photographs, consultation and Lucentis injections. Under the new system I get the scans/photographs and go home. No information on the progress of my AMD, no opportunity to ask questions or raise concerns with a consultant. “We will call you if you need an injection”. This approach leaves patients in limbo without any feedback; it may save on consultants time but is anything but ‘patient centred'. I have not received a telephone call so wonder if this is a way of saving money and my AMD will be left to deteriorate.",0
654007,"Received excellent care, support, kindness, information and encouragement once again for my second total knee replacement. I can fully recommend Pontefract hospital and all its staff for this operation, from surgeon, anaesthetist and all those involved in the daily operation of the ward. The staffing of the department was more than satisfactory in terms of staff to patient ratio, response to being called was very prompt. On both occasions the rooms I have occupied have been spacious and well appointed. In addition, I would like to highlight the cleanliness and infection control procedures. Car parking facilities are excellent for visitors and outpatient facilities, for both easy access and capacity.",0
654212,"Please improve the telephone answering service. It is real nightmare trying to get through to the different departments to enquire about appointments.The enquirer/ patient gets shunted through different people and different answering machines (which tell you not to leave a message), and then finally the line goes dead or gets cut off. The enquirer/ patient has then got to repeat the whole process at least once more, if not more times, to finally get through to a human being who actually deals with e query. Why does it have to such a trying and exhausting process? NHS Managers of the hospital - please pick up this matter, and improve your telephone service. Thank you . Date - 07 May 2019. Department and the secretary and Co-ordinator involved - I am not going to name and shame them, but NHS Managers - please check and countercheck from time to time and please improve the overall service",0
659197,My Dad suffered an attack of Sepsis which then resulted in Kidney failure. My Dad was treated at Torbay Hospital from early April to his eventual sad demise on the 2nd May. I cannot speak too highly of the care he received both initially in the Ainslie Ward then for his final week in ICU. I was particularly impressed with the level nursing care not both to the care shown to my Dad but to me as well as an extremely concerned relative. I was extremely comforted fort the level compassion shown to my Dad in his final moment. Thank you Torbay Hospital.,0
657675,"So my father was a patient at King Georges Hospital in Goodmayes on Genitan ward, suffering from Urinary sepsis. He was often left for an hour or more in his own urine and feceses while wearing a nappy. They miss meals on the ward or routinely get them wrong. They cancel appointments for ct scans because he is using the bathroom. They did not contact us or inform us when my father woke up one night with severe chest pains, they didn't call us that night when he needed an ECG nor did they tell us when we arrived in the hospital for a visit the next morning. My father informed us of what had happened the night before.",1

The Dr. didn't even introduce themselves or address my Grandma by her name, neither did they explain the procedure they were about to carry out on her. During the procedure my Grandma was in pain and stressed this to them but they just continued their work. My Grandma felt extremely humiliated and it was horrible for me to see how upset she was when she left the hospital. The Dr. may have 25 years experience, however a little compassion and reassurance towards their patients isn't much to ask. The whole situation angered me as my Grandma was very nervous before the appointment anyway and had no clue what to expect.",1
658684,"I wanted to post my review of the breast screening clinic at The Royal Free which I attended this week following an urgent referral from my GP. In contrast to the 2 previous reviews (which unfortunately added to my existing anxiety) my experience there was excellent. All of the staff, from reception, nurses & consultants were friendly, efficient and put me at ease in what was always going to be a worrying situation. Yes, it is busy and I did wait about half an hour past my appointment time but I don't think that's unusual. I can't thank our NHS enough for the great service.",0
659399,"I have attended the Polyclinic for various reasons. You do have to time your visit right as waiting time can vary, x Ray being particularly busy. However the staff are always friendly and professional. The one thing that makes visiting the Polyclinic stressful is the parking situation. Considering there is an inpatient mental health unit next door the parking facilities provided are very poor. You have to circle for quite some time to get a space. It seems staff also use the same car park which doesn't help patients and visitors so whilst the clinic is suppose to be more convenient you do need to be prepared to waiting for a parking space before waiting for your blood test, x Ray or clinic.",0

Extremely frustrating. Contacted the NHS Trust - was put through to the PALS answerphone and also received a reply to my online comment. Reply to online comment was that this issue would be passed to the head of the department.",0
660466,My son was assaulted this week whilst on a night out and attended Fairfield hospital via ambulance. Whilst at Fairfield hospital he was x-rayed and was told everything was ok and he could go home. On returning home he took himself off to bed and throughout the day was vomiting and unable to move his head due to the sheer pain so I called an ambulance who took him to North Manchester hospital where he was accessed straight away in rescus. The care my son received was second to none they gave him pain relief and did his bloods straight away and ct scan only to find out he had a fractured skull and bleed on his brain which wasn't picked up at Fairfield hospital. Both Doctors and nurses on that day couldn't do enough for my son and I am heavenly so grateful for what they did for him. They even asked me if I was ok as they knew I was upset. My son was blue lighted over to Salford royal where he was met by a specialist who again explained what was going on and he was then transferred to a ward where he is currently receiving treatment. I just want to thank all the staff who looked after my son at North Manchester hospital for all there care they gave my son I do believe you have saved his life.,1

We were all very illegal with it it was similar to swine flu I think I had over 10 years ago. You kept moving her from ward to ward & ended up on C3 & the treatment she received was disgusting we was told she had chest infection & water infection but , she wasn't allowed a drink she was very dehydrated & confused & frightened her arms were black & blue she had bruises on her head she was given antibiotics she was allergic to when we informed you that she was not to have them. She was helped to eat infact no meals were hardly given to her. They took her drip out her arm & stopped all her medication she was slowly dying they even let some scared dementia patient get in her room all the staff did was stand about doing nothing.The day she died on my aunties 70th birthday they told us she had a comfortable night but , was very tired & would probably wake when we got there but , no one was taking care of her & when my mum got there her head was right back her neck sunk in you couldn't open her eyes , she had hardly any pulse or heart beat & her hands had turned dark blue it was horrendous & the staff weren't very sympathetic just patronising & rude the place is a disgrace.",1

Lower medical personnel, such as midwives does not follow consultant instructions and ignore prescriptions. It also seems that test results are not checked regularly due to being understaffed.

664314,I found the doctor very caring and thorough and also holistic- I had follow up treatment for vitamin D problem and was given loads of advice on how I could help myself with many aspects of my health in addition to the gastroenterology issue- a lovely person. I decided to makes these comments after being shocked to receive in one week a text message for comments from the hospital at the same time as similar texts from M & S and Shell Energy!

I told the nurse I cant stay if they sprayed it but they just laughed and sprayed anyhow. I swiftly left the room and told the nurse again I could go into anaphylaxis. They never once apologised. I was disgusted this could have been seriously life threatening. The receptionist tried to play it down by saying they thought I was joking. Absolutely disgraceful and unprofessional - will not go here by choice in future.,1
666475,My husband has just spent two weeks in your hospital on three different wards . During his stay he he was very confused due to his illness . I found it very hard to get to talk to anyone about his illness. He was being told things by the doctors but was not fit enough to understand what he was being told or to remember what was said .Then after lying in bed for the whole two weeks not fit to do anything for himself he told the drs he wanted to go home and he felt fine . Because in the eyes of the hospital he had capacity to request this he was discharged . I expressed my concern to the ward staff but was told he had been discharged and there was nothing they could do . He also told them he was fit enough to do everything for himself and so no care package was arranged . I am now struggling at home to look after a very weak man who is still confused by everyday activities.,1

It is now Thursday 6th of June and I have no communication and have tried 3 separate times to get in contact - all attempts are where I am holding for over 5 minutes.

There is a suggestion that the pains are caused by my digestive system, which can mimic a heart attack, the hospital intend to carry out further investigations. The only very slight downside was that on discharge I had to vacate the bed in a hurry.

Whilst I accept that I could leave a number for staff to contact me when they have the capacity that service isn't appropriate due to my work. I find it difficult to complain about this extremely poor practice as there is no online complaints form easily available, I have found that this review service is also problematic as the confirmation email does not get sent. If this post is published it will be a miracle as I've tried numerous times.

I collapsed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy - if the ambulance personnel had been slower, the operating team slower I would be dead! after superb treatment I went on to have a daughter. When she was two, I got ill, the doctor sent me swiftly to Barts, they examined, operated for appendicitis - wasn't that! kept searching, I had ruptured intestine caused by diverticulitis I didn't know I had (my father died with what happened to me when I was 10). They operated and gave me a temporary colostomy. Superb care and one year later removed the colostomy. My Daughter collapsed with abdominal pain & high temperature - swift ambulance service, excellent A&E at Homerton Hospital, removal of ruptured appendix and treatment for sepsis [when she went back for 6 week check she was told the path lab asked for her autopsy report. They couldn't believe she'd survived! Gangrene Appendix]. Superb treatment she was out in two weeks with a fast track letter just in case she needed it. Later (2 or 3 years) she developed pain. Again Drs from Somerford Grove Medical Practice sent her straight away to the Homerton. At 10.00PM She was examined by the gynaecologist and the next day they operated and removed a grapefruit sized cyst! Excellent nursing, specialist care and wonderful scan means she survived. My husband retired, got pains in his arm (family history of heart attacks) Somerford Grove Health Practice immediately sent him to University College Hospital for tests resulting in 3 stents at Royal Brompton. Then he collapsed a few days later. We phoned 911 they were superb. Ambulance in 5 mins. He had sepsis from gallstones and abscess on liver. Homerton Hospital got it all sorted.

Today (2 days later) my wife's leg had swollen badly both above the wound site and below. I called paramedics who on arrival informed us that the wound was infected. They expressed surprise that my wife had not been given antibiotics, especially given the fact that she was only released from hospital one week ago after having a collapsed lung. I called the department to ask them to reassure me that my wife would be checked for Sepsis. The nurse who answered the call was very curt and ultimately when i Insisted she put the phone down.

Once you've arrived and let the receptionist know, a nurse will come to take urine sample and do the general checks i.e. blood pressure, weight etc. The receptionist also hands in envelopes detailing your next appointment. Shortly after this a midwife will see you in her room to explain and fill in the pregnancy file. In between this you'll be asked to give a blood sample. The whole process was smooth transition, comfortable and very time efficient. The midwife was very sweet and made time for conversation.

The unit was well signposted and the spacious adjacent car park was a very pleasant surprise as many NHS centres are now cramped due to vital extensions and expansions. The reception area, just a few steps away from the car park was well-equipped and staffed by a very friendly and professional receptionist who dealt with my checking-in quickly and kindly. After a short wait for my appointment time, I was called in, on time, by the mammogram operator. You enter the room, remove your top and very quickly have 2 films taken of each breast. A few preliminary questions having been asked. The operator put me at my ease, had a very pleasant manner, and worked efficiently to complete the tasks. My few questions were answered with up to date information about the extension to the upper age level for screening, which was welcome and reassuring news.

Despite multiple requests from the relative to have the blood test, the ED doctor refused on a number of times. Instead the ED doctor said that my grandmother must have a urine infection (when she clearly does not), and blindly gave a course of antibiotics (Nitrofurantoin) which are absolutely unsafe for my grandmother considering her poor kidney function. Had the Dr looked/asked about her kidney function? Did my grandmother even need antibiotics for an apparent urine infection - that had already been ruled out by her own GP (understandably). My grandmother could be sent into severe kidney failure should she continue these inappropriate antibiotics, and let us just hope that her blood count does not pose any threat to her.",1

He spent two days on the ward and was then moved to Cardiac Care Unit (He has a pacemaker). he was subsequently moved on to Keats ward. He was in hospital for two weeks. The consultant, medical staff and auxillary staff were amazing. Thanks to their timely actions and ongoing care he was discharged and sent home to convalesce. Thank you to all concerned.",0
675392,Appalling post OP care of my elderly aunt following hysterectomy and repair in May 2019. She was not offered a wash during her stay and had to ask a nurse for a bowl to wash as she had difficulty getting to the bathroom. She was aghast at the treatment of an elderly patient next to her and stated the nurse treated her 'roughly'. She complained of chest pain/indigestion pain and denied any medication. She was discharged still in pain and attended her GP within 2hours. I find this appalling as she has high blood pressure and on medication. I'm absolutely disgusted by her poor treatment and care. I certainly think the CQC should be checking this hospital.,1

The attention to detail incredible in ensuring that the corset fits exactly right so that I can get the maximum benefit from it. The service I am getting is 5 star, and it just makes me appreciate our wonderful NHS all the more. As usual, easy reasonably priced parking, helpful and courteous receptionists and booking clerks. One more visit before my corset is completed.",0
675805,I tried to call on the times mentioned on the last page of the leaflet. It says..weekdays between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm call 01276 52484 number..At the weekend call between 5:00 pm and 9:00am on this other number 01276 604604 but the departments are closed during that period at the weekend..Seems a misprint as the times should be the same with different phone numbers..Spoke the the reception on the automatic voice system answer and was confirmed there in no Eye Doctor on Call untill 9:00am. I had an emergency call about my good lady at 5:00am in the morning regarding the cataract op the day before so had to wait the other 4 hours before I could talk to someone. Not good..,0

After a consultation with Grantham Hospital A&E Dept it was decide to take her to the Lincoln County Hospital where it was diagnosed that her left upper arm had been broken. She was treated in the Lincoln County Hospital A&E Dept, A web brace was fitted and she was then placed into the Neustadt Welton Ward. Over the next three weeks we were told that a further operation was needed but a heart condition had been detected. Despite our denials we were still in the County Hospital until one day I asked to see the paperwork. I noticed straight away that although the paperwork was showing someone with the same name as my wife and spelt the same way in was a different date of birth!! the person named on the paperwork was born in 1964 whilst my wife was born in 1935!!

The Doctor and her Clinical Asst have been nothing but supportive over the past year in stabilising my wife's condition. This team is world class and we really do appreciate we are receiving the best care, advice and support. To ease the burden on travel the Guy's team is enabling us to visit Royal Surrey haematology an equally impressive department. We are particularly impressed by the end-to-end support not just from the technical team but from the support staff who are always helpful and keep us informed with either email, phone or text messaging. People are frequently quick to be critical but VERY slow to highlight the exceptional care they receive. In writing this note we are striving to re-dress the balance in favour of the positive.

From first to last, all staff were friendly, helpful and totally professional. In our view, they went out of their way to ensure the visit was stress-free as possible. We saw the very best of the NHS, from the admin staff and the two nurses in the DVT scan unit (sorry, don't know the correct name for this unit!) to the radiographer who did the scan.

680611,"I have Occulopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. I have difficulty opening my eyes, swallowing and general muscular weakness. It affects about 1 in 100,000 people in Europe. This brought me into contact with the RFH Neuromuscular rehabilitation unit at Colindale. They encouraged me to attend a six week introduction to exercise course. This taught me to use Gym equipment such as static exercise bikes, Hand Bikes, Tread mills, and various pieces of muscle tensioning equipment. The instructors included a member of the Better gym staff, a physiotherapist and rehab assistant, all of whom were helpful and non-judgemental. At the end of the course we were encouraged to join the gym at a special rate of £1.60 (now waived) and pay for a weekly session at £4.55. If we go on a Tuesday morning we can maintain contact with the Neuro-rehabilitation team. I think that this regular exercise session coupled with walking and a simple set of home exercises, has stopped me from becoming disabled. It also provides mental stimulation as there is a small hard core of people from previous courses who attend the gym on Tuesdays, so it has provided a social element. Which is useful. I can thoroughly recommend the neuro-rehab course and the pathway it has provided to a moderate level of fitness.",0

Interesting guest speakers are invited so those attending will have listening to some brilliant Specialist Doctors, Nurses and Therapists focusing on MS Patients and their concerns. The meetings give those in the MS Club the opportunity to take advantage of the advice and explanations and suggestions of the speakers, meet up with others and just talk among themselves, perhaps exchanging experiences and ideas. The care of Bhaani, who started this group and her assistant Jenelyn is fantastic. They have worked so hard to make sure really magical speakers that are helpful and relevant to our problems.

681663,"My elderly 82 year old mother had been suffering from severe stomach pain and associated symptoms for some time before finally the pain became too much and she was taken to Peterborough Hospital via Ambulance to A&E. She was then admitted to B14 Ward for diagnostic investigation and treatment. When was then moved to a room with other patients the problems really began !. Constantly other elderly patients who clearly had dementia were being moved into the ward room and shouting out, ranting and banging all night long in the room. One male patient from somewhere else on the ward was continually entering the room late at night at all hours staring at those within, frightening other patients – nothing was done about it. The family were so concerned on what they witnessed on one occasion that they refused to leave at visiting time unless something was done. It was clear there was general apathy to the situation and lack of responsibility and constant fobbing off to the patient and their family. Such was our concern we left my mother a mobile phone to call us at any time of day or night. I visibly watched my mothers' mental state deteriorate on the ward through lack of sleep and exhaustion to the constant noise. She waited 8 days for a CT Scan that was never forthcoming and finally after a torturous 11 day stay, the family received a phone call at 0200hrs in the morning from a very distressed, anxious and distraught elderly 82 yr old lady pleading with the family to come and fetch her as she could take no more (I had later found that she had resorted to going into the toilet cubicle in the room and shutting the door just to get some peace in the night When family members arrived at 0230hrs in the morning it was evident that there was no way my mother could stay in the situation, as they had placed an elderly patient in the room who had been shouting, wailing and screaming for the last 5 hours and the staff at the hospital came out with the usual “no beds” cannot do anything about it – when it should have been done a lot earlier. My mother “with a continuous headache” self discharged herself at 0245hrs still with no treatment for her condition (which we don't know if it is cancerous) and no help from the staff at the hospital regarding her ongoing care and keeping her CT scan booked on the system so she could attend “whenever” it may be It was all absolutely appalling. My mother is still having nightmares now about it all. How she stuck it out so long is beyond me- she desperately wanted to get better- but they FAILED HER. To those who helped my mother in hospital and treated her with empathy - I thank them. To those who fobbed her off, took no responsibility to help her and did not “care a jot” – you should be ashamed of yourself.",1
681723,"Traumatised deeply traumatised by my father's treatment. I frequently heard my father cry out in pain and distress when attended by the nursing staff on Heathfield One, but one Friday night was deeply deeply distressing for me as l listened to my father calling out in agony and distress for over an hour. The staffing levels were low the nurse could was not available, one charge nurse and one agency nurse took no notice whatsoever ever. I sought out a doctor, who swished in and out of the curtains without any explanation. My father's cries did not stop. I summoned the doctor a second time. They mentioned my father had been referred to the Royal Marsden as if that reduced his pain. An hour later l sought out the doctor again but was intercepted by the charge nurse who may have or may not have found the doctor, but followed up by swishing in behind the blue curtain. After an hour my father's heart wrenching calls of agony subsided. I was informed on the following Monday my father had had a second heart attack. Was l shocked? No, l was lucky l did not have a heart attack listening to my elderly father call out in agony and observe how unconcerned the nursing and medical staff were. My father did experience very visible episodes of pain throughout his stay on the ward. When l asked the doctor had they discovered the reason for these distressing spasms, I was just told “They were not logged”. The doctor seemed unconcerned and not especially interested in following up on what l said. [Very unhappy with 'Explanations']",1

685209,"My almost 91 year old Mother was admitted to The Pilgrim Hospital and was taken to ward 7B where she had been a few weeks previous. She had problems with her heart rate. She was put in a 4-bed ward and there were some very sick people in the ward but because of their treatment, they needed the curtains around which meant that my mother wasn't given any attention other than obs, food and delivering a commode for her to use. Often leaving her on it longer than she needed. Due to the lack of attention she slept through the day and was unable to sit up which would have helped her breathing and wellbeing. Then the day it was decided she was being discharged she was dressed and put in a wheelchair and taken to the discharge area. There wasn't an ambulance to take her available til 8.30 pm. I was not informed Mum was being discharged, my Sister wasn't informed she was being Discharged AND her Carehome wasn't informed she was being discharged.

Staff were shocked that we had been directed there as my child had suffered severe stomach trauma and unbeknown to us due to recently moving to the area the hospital doesn't have any paediatrics. The staff quickly treated my child and called for an ambulance to transfer us so that my child could be admitted at another hospital. Unfortunately we had to wait until the following morning for that ambulance to arrive. The doctor that treated my child finished his shift while we were still waiting but he was fantastic. The head of resus was disgusted to find us still waiting at 3am so he again called for the ambulance and shouted that he had a category 1 paediatric patient with severe stomach trauma and no paediatrics on site so get that ambulance here now! I would like to thank those two doctors for their care to my child, he was eventually rushed for emergency surgery as he had a hole in his bowel. Due to complications with infections from the bowel leaking into his tummy his wound from surgery split open so he is still recovering 3 months on!",1

On accessing the main page I looked at the Facilities and Dept lists but could not find MRI and so trawled through the list to find Diagnositic Services but no mention of MRI. I then looked up other services but could not find X Ray Dept and so had to resort to ringing the main number to be told MRI was in the X Ray dept and where to find the dept. Why is the main list devoid of MRI or X ray location as a main heading ? This would be helpful to other patients.,0

688004,"The staff at MDGH have always been excellent, very caring and professional. This review is focusing on a single point, which sounds petty but was particularly annoying. The printer in the registrar's office is networked via Ethernet. Consequently, printing documents (e.g. Death Certificates) does not work effectively. This, at a time when you are dealing with the loss of a loved one, is a ridiculous failing. The printer should be local and dedicated. It has a USB connection. No-one else in MDGH will print to that printer so TAKE IT OFF THE NETWORK. If you watch the Ethernet port on the printer, it's flashing orange and green, suggesting it's actively polling the network when it should be printing local documents. If your policy states that all printers should be universally accessible, can I suggest you consider this specific use case, and add an exception to the policy.",0

He was released from hospital later that night with shards of glass still stuck in his face, no painkillers, no follow up appointment and no MRI scan despite the fact that he has hit his head quite hard and had significant injuries to his head and SHOULD have had an MRI! during the accident his feet became trapped in the pedals and he recalls that his car was filling with smoke and he thought he was going to die. Once he was freed and his friend pulled him away he witnessed the man in the other car burn to death. he was offered no psychological help which is clearly needed and he was sent home unable to walk by himself but with no crutches or pain killers. he then woke up in agony with no painkillers and was forced to phone someone, wake them up and have them bring him painkillers as I was in excruciating pain and the hospital failed to prescribe him any.

689111,I have over the period of a week twice been taken to A&E and been in the examination room having blood taken when a drunk patient caused a disturbance. in the first instance the drunk became aggressive toward the staff and fell heavily on top of a very frail elderly lady lying on a trolley .she was very distressed and I believe an injury she had made worse. the next incident on15 /08/ 2019 in the same examination room was another drunk who became violent and threatening toward staff fell over several times causing alarm to patients. he eventually walked out obviously drunk and aggressive. He seemingly fell into the bushes outside A&E and brought back in slightly more sober.

A few days later he started with the same pains vomiting the exact symptoms as before but he wouldn't go back thinking they would just fob him off so after 2 days of agony I took him to LGI where the doctor and staff were fantastic, sent him for X-ray straight away and he has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What a difference in medical team never judged my husband for been a alcoholic and did everything they could as they knew he was a very poorly man.

Having landed on my face speaking was difficult and at all times Doctors and Nurses made sure I knew what was happening.I was admitted to the Trauma Ward where again I met and saw only kindness and my injuring paled in comparison to the confusion of other patients who surrounded me. One of the incidents which impressed me was the Doctor who discharged me asking me back for a vein scan as she was concerned as to whether I had a thrombosis. Fortunately not.We were referred to Western Eye Clinic and MaxFax at Northwick Park and following surgery I am on the mend.

She collapsed in the Wessex Neurological Centre, was taken into intensive-care and died 5 days later. I was at her side holding her hand all night, she died 20 minutes after I left the bedside. I refused to believe she would die. I was told her illness was not recoverable. The WNC were very good, and I do not apportion blame. I would advise others who are faced with this situation, to keep an open mind. If I could go back, I would have taken her home to die in her own bed. The breathing tube made communication impossible.

Trouble is Worthing does not have enough capacity to deal with special needs required to assess and accommodate patients in a very stressful A&E environment.

Also there is minimal communication between staff and patients to update on progress and treatment options. After assessment, there is often no availability of beds in the county for mental health in patients which further prevents bed availability in A&E. There must be a better way.",0
692998,"To begin with, both the designated parking areas on the Greetwell Rd side of the complex are below the hospital level. In particular, the one nearest the Outpatients Clinic entrance has a severe slope up, meaning that driver/patients that have manual wheelchairs have an impossible task to access the building. Secondly, the CCTV controlled parking system offers a lower fee for Blue Badge holders. You register your number plate and when you use the machines to pay, you are supposed to get the lower fee AUTOMATICALLY. That is the theory but in practise, the pay machine regularly fails to recognise the vehicle number as being valid for the discounted price and charges the full price. This happened to me yet again on 31-08-19 and I had to pay £5 after spending half the day in A&E with my disabled daughter..

I walked back to the x-ray reception and I was called through after a 10 - 12 minute wait. The x-ray again took around five minutes and that was it. Everyone that I met and spoke to was helpful, friendly and good natured. The bus back to town was even on time. An excellent facility with wonderful staff.10 out of 10. Thank you.",0
693644,"Yesterday, I had to attend Epsom Woodcote Wing (G Block) for a dermatology appointment with the specialist nurse. The signage, directions to this new outpatient facility is non existent and people were like me walking around looking for where they should report. The previous location next to A&E still has 'entrance to G Block' on a general sign on the wall above an entrance. Going over to the new G Block the only signs relate to cardiology and there is no sign to direct patients round the back and up the stairs to the new outpatient facility, which seems to cater for a variety of out patient appointments. Once I found the department and was called, I had to report to treatment room 2, and without directions I walked, following the declining room numbers, the length of the department to the wrong room 2, which was at the extreme other end of the long corridor. I understand this facility is only two weeks into service. I trust that clear signage will soon be installed to direct patients to this department. In the meantime at least some temporary signs would surely be welcome.",0
694236,"Permanent brain damage, huge life changes and having to deal with problems when accepting my health now is and has been hard enough. I had viral encephalitis and was in hospital for almost a month. I was treated with patience and understanding. I was discharged earlier because my father had passed away and his funeral was the day after I was discharged. I didn't know about my father until 4 days before his funeral. I was then near bed bound for 3 months whilst my husband was breaking me financially. I was so lost and couldn't live. I was so lost. I didn't remember things or language. It's too much to explain on here but it has been such a journey.",0
694716,"STAY: Approx. 36 hours, 2 days and 1 night. WARD: Surgery Ward 1. PROCEDURE: Minor surgery requiring General Anaesthetic. TRIAGE: Completed within my first hour on arrival to A&E. WAITING TIME: Approx. 3 hours due to higher priority cases, did not Breach. WAITING ROOM: Some chairs were comfy whilst others were not; a small, semi-open section with a broken vending machine, chairs, side tables and magazines was also available as part of the waiting area. INITIAL ASSESSMENT(S): Seen and cannulated by Nurse (friendly and competent), then seen twice by a Junior Doctor (friendly and competent) and then seen by a Registrar Surgeon (friendly and competent). Transferred to Ward and given bed not long after. WARD BED: Large, comfortable mattress that is able to be electronically adjusted via Staff. WARD ROOM: 6-person communal room with draw-around curtains providing sufficient (at least for me) privacy for each patient, as well as space to maneuever within a fully-drawn curtain. 1 of the 4 curtain sides is shared with the adjacent patient however, rather than having all 4 curtain ""walls"" being independently your own. Adjustable tray is provided which is sufficent for many tasks such as eating/reading/organizing etc. WARD FACILITIES: Plenty of nearby toilets, showers are thermostat operated and can be manually adjusted, toilet flusher and sink taps have to be physically activated with handles rather than with IR touchless sensors like in some other nearby Units. All toilets/showers appeared to be Disabled-Friendly. Some showers would leak though and water would spread across to the far-side of the room's floor, take care when showering so as to not have any clothing on the floor drenched accidentally. Pretty much all bathroom lights were physical switches/cords and not automatic IR activated ones like in other Units. The ward facilities and slightly claustrophobic environment were probaby the weakest part of this review: they were adequate but not special. FOOD: Sufficient choice, quality and accomodations for Kosher/Halal/Vegetarian/Easy Chew/Low Fibre/Higher Energy/portion size were made clear on the menu which is given to you daily, the food is also given to you at your bed, rather than a communal dining room. Additional food and drinks can be requested by staff 24/7 (something which I did use!). One Nurse did accidentally attempt to give me a sandwich that had been 4 days expired, however once I alerted Nurse to it, they quickly apologized and sorted me with a proper lunch pack from downstairs. STAFF: Very friendly, kind, attentive to my needs, displayed empathy, were accomodating, were not dismissive or patronizing, open to conversation/had a laugh when less busy and were all-around very pleasant. I would probably say the staff performance, competence and behaviour make up the strongest part of my review: they were lovely, zero negative instances - unlike in other nearby Units, sadly. I enjoyed my stay, thank you for helping me.",0
695082,"i have been referred by my GP fro a XRAY. Being aware of the demand on this service, I decided to contact the hospital to ask what would be the best time- least demand to come for my Xray.. I rang the listed 512512 number on Saturday 7th September at 5.03.pm It took the main switchboard 4- 5 mins to answer and then I requested a transfer to the XRay Dept. 29 minutes YES 29 MINUTES LATER - after being bounced from direct dial tone to music I was connected to the XRAY Dept. Who answer my query. I consider this a DISGRACEFUL SERVICE RESPONSE. This is a hospital.with no doubt heavy demands. HOWEVER to take this length of time to answer the phone is UNACCEPTABLE and only contributes to the poor image & negative feelings about the NHS.

701280,"Taken to Heartlands A +E by ambulance suffering severe abdominal pain. I was admitted and treated by a doctor who checked me physically and asked me questions I informed him i hadn't had a bowel movement for 2-3days which was unusual. The doctor then checked my bladder and waterworks to rule out a UTI. I was sent for a X ray and I returned and waited for the result. The doctor came not long after and informed me I had a compacted blocked bowel and admitted me for treatment. I was moved to ward 11 and waited for a long time in agonising pain. A junior doctor came to see me and all they was interested in was how much I was drinking. I explained I hardly drunk anymore and hadn't for some time because I have pancreatitis through alcohol. The other doctor saw me in the afternoon and basically insulted me made out I was lying about the drinking and my pancreatitis had escalated to acute and if I drank anymore I would die. I explained about the A+E doctor's diagnosis and was abruptly told that A+E doctor's know nothing and this person was the authority. I tried to explain the pain was not pancreatitis as my lower bowel was swollen and agonising with pain, again they brushed it off and left. I spent 3 days in unbelievable pain and feared for my life as my friend was in the other ward after a similar thing, he had most of his bowel removed and was on death's door in ICU. One evening i was in so much pain i begged a nurse for help, who made a call and after 20mins a porter arrived with some powder which turned out to be a children's laxative. I took it and after 30 minutes i started passing wind and the swelling started to go and the pain decreased. I went out and walked around for 2 hours passing wind and eventually had a large bowel movement which itself was painful. Eventually I managed to evacuate and felt brilliant. The doctor never came back to see me and I learnt I was being discharged the next day. The doctors had no idea that i had effectively self medicated and cured myself. It stands to reason that the doctors were quite oblivious to my blockage and were willing to send me home with a life threatening problem. Nor did these so called doctor's check my records,if they had they would have seen I have diverticulitis and IBD. Instead they assumed it was pancreatitis and never examined me correctly or listened to what I told them. I am disgusted with Heartlands and the so called doctors. And i intend to take the matter as far as i can.",1

704112,"Visited a friend in Marjorie Warren ward at this hospital on Sunday afternoon 6/10/19. Found difficulty getting access to the ward via the entry intercom/door lock. No response to press on intercom button, beyond slight crackling noise from speaker - sounded like faulty intercom. Called into microphone(?), no response. Tried again, tried to push door open on crackling sound from intercom. Door not opening. We repeated this about four or five times, hearing crackling, calling on intercom, trying to open door. Door remained locked. Finally, pressed and held intercom button for about 10-15 seconds. At last! More crackling from intercom speaker and this time door released. Went in. Once inside female member of staff started to explain how to 'use intercom' - I know HOW to use an intercom, this one DOESN'T WORK. Tried to explain this to staff member. Wouldn't listen. Started haranguing me for being ""rude"" for pressing on intercom. INTERCOM DOESN'T WORK, that's the problem.

I was rolling about on those hard chairs in agony and eventually my daughter had to ask for a sick bowel and I filled five of those cardboard receptacles, my daughter had to deal with all of it and no nurse came to help or showed any concern, probably because they were so overwhelmed with patients. Eventually I asked my daughter to take me to Basildon Hospital which I knew well and also feel their A&E was far more efficient, which proved to be the case as I was quickly admitted and diagnosed with Acute Hepatitis. I received first class care from the doctors and nurses at Basildon Hospital and was home within a few days. I feel I could easily have died if I had stayed at QEQM.",1

I would like to thanks all the staff for the kind and supportive way that John was cared for during his final illness and particularly Kieran for updating me as his son regularly on his condition and explaining everything.

704975,"My mother was in hospital aged 96 (2 years ago) and nearing the end of her life. She had bowel, urinary and kidney problems. She did not want to undergo a further colonoscopy so her precise condition was undiagnosed. We had asked that they make her as comfortable as possible as she had advanced arthritis which gave her considerable pain. We visited her most days to find that she had been put on her side (she had not been able to sleep on her side for over 10 years) and was crying out in pain to be moved as she was unable to move herself. When I saw her notes, it said that she had been diagnosed with Dementia, so I guess this was why her cries were being ignored. She was profoundly deaf, but did not have Dementia, but was simply in pain. Had she been given handwritten questions, she would have answered coherently when they were testing her as we used to use a notepad ourselves to communicate with her. She left hospital and died in a nursing home 10 days later. We felt that we had failed our mother as despite all our efforts, we could not get her the palliative care that she needed and deserved. My point here is that there is a huge gulf in treatment between those with a diagnosis of terminal cancer where pain control is offered and those dying with other painful conditions. My mother was only given Paracetamol. Dying of ""old age"" is not always painless process and I feel that more should be done to help such patients.",1

The same thing happened with his brother who donated his kidney he was left with agonizing pains and nurses did not respond to our requests to help them, the pain nurses were apparently called on 1 particular day less than 2 days after surgery and when I arrived was told it had been 4 hrs since they'd been called and they still hadn't sorted his pain out. I am very disappointed with both of their treatments, leaving patients that have had surgery in so much pain as if they don't deserve to be comfortable. I am putting in a complaint to PILS so that hopefully this won't happen to somebody else's relative.

708542,"We took my partners 18 year old son to the Arrowe Park Hospital walk in centre. He was in agony with pain from his abdomen. Vomiting and almost loosing consciousness. We where told that he could wait 4 hours so try AE. A very inhuman response awaited us at AE, a further wait of 4 hours. My partner was distraught watching her son in agony and being told that she was being rude by a very officious nurse who was totally lacking human skills did not help our situation. This young man was in agony and the waiting room was full of people with sore fingers and colds, drunks and drug takers. What is classed as an emergency? After demanding to see and eventually seeing a manager who clearly could see the distress this young man was suffering, he was admitted and after treatment and examination told that he has a serious medical problem that requires immediate investigation. And in the opinion of an AE doctor he has been let down by his GP and the NHS. The point I am making in this review is the lack of humility and common sense from desk checkin staff. They could clearly see the distress and pain this young man was in. Yet they were prepared to let him wait for 4 hours. They become impatient with a parent in distress. They were prepared to let him wait behind those with sore fingers and colds. There has to be a more efficient method of identifying an emergency. As for the staff lacking in humility they need training or they should ask themselves should they be in a caring profession. This hospital is constantly letting down those who it serves, the community that depends upon it. ",1

710061,"I am sorry but as part of you regular reviews at the NHS I am not happy at your standards of care. Patients are being left unattended, there are poor staffing levels, I do not notice much diversity in your organisation, the pay is poor, the staff can be rude at times. The canteen has a poor selection of food on offer especially for this with special diets, the police are always there why and for what reason. On a better note, the NHS is a safer place to visit. There are warm places for patients and their associates to be seated, parking is clear and fair at times although the prices are high in some of the car parks. The staff are helpful and provide information, the corridors and walkways are clearly marked to where one has to go to, there is a calm ambience in many of the places. The hospital chapels are nice and roomy. There is provision for all faiths and those of none to visit and feel peace. There are lovely green spaces that one can sit and contemplate on. the making green of brown spaces with a touch of black in and amongst the white. The walks through the premises are nice with lots of works of art that really help with the emotions of patients and staff alike dealing with difficult situations. More referring to exercise classes would be beneficial for the patients to help with the recuperation from medical events and as an aide-Ameliorette to their respective treatments. A library of books for health and for leisure could be made available for the public who visit and themed cafes to relax and take a break. Announcements do punctuate the air and lead one on to their final destination but let it be good. For me sandwich, crisps, some fruit and a glass of water from bottle would be nice. The service is decent and I am satisfied with it all. More vegetarian and vegan food selection is asked for and more trips to parks in sensible and mature groups is desired. Well down to all who participated. Congratulate yourself on this and many more achievements in the offing. Big thank you with love and light. If all else fails ask someone for help and if not then the next and next until something is learned and understood. Merci et ciao. ",0

He had been responding well to his treatment however, over the previous few days before he was admitted to The Royal Cornwall Hospital, he started to experience various problems - a new DVT in his leg, stomach pains and lastly chest pains. Sadly he declined with devastating speed and he died surrounded by his wife, tiny daughter, and his brother, sisters and close friends who had made a frantic dash to be with him.. The treatment and care he received was superb in Critical Care/ITU. The nursing staff were amazing in every aspect, his doctors kept us informed, explaining each step of his treatment in a clear and compassionate way and treated us with the utmost respect. Thank you so much for kindness you showed us at this devastating time.",0
710347,"I had an appointment with a senior consultant in the Cardiology Dept - outpatients B and found the whole experience very relaxing due to the wonderfully pleasant manner of the very friendly but professional consultant. All of my questions were answered in layman's terms. The consultant was very patient and is a credit to the NHS. This department is in the old buildings of the hospital and is in need of a refurbishment, although it is very clean, but the wonderful reception given by the staff more than make up for the surroundings. Well done!",0
710354,"I was referred to the A&E department at the hospital by my GP as I had an infected cyst. The staff were professional and the service was efficient. Some comments as follows: 1. It might be an idea to explain what AEC means and how it fits into the A&E department. 2. I would suggest putting AEC posters in A&E to show the flow of emergency treatment. 3. The walk to AEC is outside and the signage is not clear. I realise that this temporary and I hope it will clearer in future. The major comment is the lack of car parking, it took me >30 minutes to find a space. I am sure that this is a regular complaint and is a black mark on what is an excellent facility. ",0
710532,"X-ray department - arrived at walk service was seen immediately and registered. Was called in and advised my doctor had not completed form correctly and X-ray could not take place. They advised ringing surgery to send through correct information and they would then do X-ray - did this and after waiting over 40 mins for surgery to send through went back to department. Was called in straight away - super service. The staff were all very professional, polite, friendly and extremely helpful from the reception area through to X-ray. I am very impressed. The hospital was very clean as well. Overall impressive. ",0
710534,"Generally the NHS provides an excellent service to the public but the way in which results of tests are conveyed back to the patient can sometimes feel rather unsatisfactory. This can involve ringing your GP to receive nothing more than ""you're OK"" or an anxious wait for post with the no news is good news policy. By contrast, the service provided by the Audiology department at Treliske has been excellent in the way that the patient has face to face contact with specialists. Mrs Crompton, Hearing Therapist, spent many hours going through results with me and patiently explained courses of action. Further appointments to check progress were much appreciated and very useful.",0
710629,"Initially went to GP. Was given the phone no' for self-referral. Simple, straightforward process. Was seen within a few days. Friendly informal dept. Was happy with exercise & ‘homework'. Attended once a wk, then 2wkly & finally once a month for approx 8mths. Also received several courses of Acupuncture during physio sessions. I have also had a referral to PARS. My physio sessions have now finished. But, My file has been left open if I should need to return in the future.. Via self-referral process. I had a good relationship with my assigned physiotherapist.I am content with the complete service I received. Thank You. Regards, EF.",0
711431,"I attended the department today my 3rd visit. Every time I've visited the staff from the health care support workers scan technicians and consultants offer an efficient friendly reassuring service. On arrival the tests eye tests.,scans,field vision and consultation with the consultant are all done with minimal waiting . Each person including the consultant explained thoroughly what test they were doing and why taking their time and answering all questions. Each person I was in contact with was so friendly and seemed happy as well as knowledgeable in what they were doing. This department is excellent and has staff who care are knowledgeable and are happy in their work . The service they provide is excellent and Bassetlaw hospital should feel proud they have such dedicated staff working for them. ",0
711497,I was admitted with chest pains .after 8 days sent home with pain relief medication and anti inflammatory medication.i was admitted 5 days later with stomach pain to be told I had hepatitis viral liver infection.was not given any medication but was told to take medication that cardio had given me.2 days later taken back to A-E with stomach pains to be told that the tablets I had been taking were painkillers and I had not been given inflammatory medication plus I was told by cardio I could take paracetamol but they did not proscribe this so actually I had been taking 8 paracetamol plus other tablets that they had proscribe.so I had been with out inflammatory medication for a week and four days.they want me to have pysho treatment but I was diagnosed with pericarditis and been having pain in between my shoulder blades.so not happy at all with treatment.,1
711778,"Both my visits to Cardiology have been necessary to check out possible abnormalities, so the wearing of a heart monitor has been required, firstly for 24 hrs then secondly for 72 hours. Reception staff and Nurse/Technician staff were welcoming, warm & helpful on both occasions, & it was marvellous to be seen on time/before appointment time, however, I'd like to suggest that (a) more info is given to patients ref the heart monitor itself - such as the sound it emits if electrodes are coming loose - can this be stopped by pressing a button & if so, which one, or (b) should the electrode be refitted & if that's the case, spare ""stickers"" must be given before the patient leaves, together with some guidance. (there needs to be some sort of tick box system to check that the Nurse technician has provided spares) Also, as electrodes are fitted in the lying down position when the chest is flat, if there is any spare fat on the chest, as soon as you move, then, depending on the location of the central electrode, it's very likely to peel off without any strenuous movement or exercise. It was only on returning the monitor that a staff member gave reassurance that providing the 2 electrodes fitted to left and right of the chest stay firmly in place, then readings should be possible. Whatever tests are required, invariably, it's an anxious time, so had we had more information at the time of fitting, I believe this would have helped. ",0
711872,"Firstly after a doctors home visit mum who is 90 years of age was informed she needs to go to hospital after a suspected fall. The doctor advised her not to eat or drink anything in case she needed surgery. 12 hours later the ambulance turned up to collect her! Mum was admitted and accessed , eventually diagnosed with pneumonia. After 5 nights on the CDU ward she was transferred to Kimberley ward at the Norfolk and Norwich University hospital . On the Sunday Mum complained to me about her bed being uncomfortable. On checking the air mattresses was deflated. I glanced at the pump and saw it was registering a fault. So I spoke to nursing staff. One carer told me that it was fine and when mum gets into bed it inflates! I am sure that no one ever checked the bed again. I spoke with my brother who visited later, the mattress was still deflated and the pump still showed the same fault. The carer then insisted that it was rectified. Had he not have gone to visit she would have been left to sleep on a deflated mattress once again. I have been working in care for 20years and never would I put a patient onto a deflated mattress let alone leave a patient miss-treated in this way.",1
711847,"Suggested service improvement. Currently at Medway Maritime Hospital you see a consultant for your problem, he gives you a form to take to XRAY department for an appointment for a MRI Scan. Xray reception take the form and tell you they will ring within 2 weeks to book an appointment. I wonder how many desks the form passes through before a telephone call is made. System should be simplified allowing either the Consultant to book the appointment during the consultation or at a minimum the Xray department reception should book the appointment. Why create an unnecessary delay and additional work by placing the referral sheet in a tray and passing it around to whoever makes the appointment and telephone call. Creates unnecessary administration and possible delays to future treatment. Time and money can clearly be saved.",0
712169,"Attended with my daughter who is experiencing severe mental health issues and self harming. She had injured herself and needed stitches, and was very distressed. The triage nurse was curt, showed no compassion and tried to steristrip a wound that clearly needed stitches. I'm a nurse myself and know when her wounds require more than steristripping. Furthermore, her triage assessment was woefully inadequate. She wasn't asked how she was feeling, she wasn't asked about any other injuries (there were more), and she showed no concern whatsoever for either of us. She did not ask about any future risk. She failed to bring painkillers after being asked and put her hand up to tell me she was busy when I approached her. We were shown nothing but kindness and compassion from the admin staff on the desk when we booked in, but sadly the triage nurse didn't hide her feelings of annoyance or lack of empathy. On my insistence we were transferred to A&E where the staff were brilliant as always, sutured her quickly and admitted her to the ward for further observation and assessment. We experienced the worst and the best of nursing care during this episode. ",0
713277,"Mother admitted to A and E via ambulance after collapse at home when one of her legs failed to function despite all health checks being fine. Admitted midday and seen by doctor over several hours later. Doctor requested a call to establish more history and had assumed it was a fall and did not appreciate the dysfunction of leg and stated further checks to be made and could he call back to let me know re admission or discharge. Waited and waited finally at 21.44 after several attempts to contact A and E was told she had been discharged at 19.30 and after asking where she was, told she was waiting for ambulance home. At 23.15 informed she was enroute home. Stated that they did not realise they needed to inform her 90yr old husband and carer or anyone that she was being discharged. Totally unprofessional and undermines the excellent work carried out by the hospital. Also makes a mockery of dementia care. Apologies but upset by lack of thought and care for both of my parents. ",1
713797,"My sister was admitted to this ward, unfortunately, as an emergency. I cannot believe the appalling standard of care, compassion, knowledge that she experienced here before we got her transferred to a cardiac ward. She was admitted in a bemused state, but she was not suffering from dementia, we had to insist that a catheter was inserted as she was unable to pass water on her own, she then passed over 3 litres, imagine the pain at holding that back. We had to insist that she was given fluids as she was in pain from lack of fluids. She was insulin dependant and we had to insist that her blood sugars were taken and insulin given, however the incorrect insulin was administered. This ward appears to be a ward where patients, who in staff eyes are not going to survive, are ignored, in pain, until they give up. She was given a ""do not resuscitate "" order by doctor without any consultation with relatives. By complaining we got her transferred to a cardiac ward, where she should have been initially, she then received excellent palliative care before she passed away. An appalling experience for her and her family and one which was totally avoidable. She had been a nurse herself and would never have stooped to the awful standards of care and compassion that were experienced in this place.",1
714343,"I went into the women and children's ward in Hull Royal for my first every surgery. And was looked after so well by the surgeons, the nurses and everyone on the ward. They never rushed me or dismissed me, when I said I felt sick they helped and when I said I was in pain they fixed it. The nurse held my hand and helped calm me down right before the surgery and never rushed me one bit as I was terrified. Even though everyone was clearly massively busy and rushed off their feet they always helped with a smile when they could. Even explaining everything clearly for me afterwards and taking time to help me control my irrational fears. Thank you to everyone so much you made a terrifying experience far less scary than it could have been. ",0
715425,"I had a full hip replacement. The process was superb from start to finish. Everyone I encountered was professional & friendly in all departments: admission (day surgery), surgical/anaesthetist teams, recovery team, ward 8 team, physios: all fantastic. I was able to go home on the same day, & they made regular follow up calls to make sure I was ok. The facilities are top notch. I had my other hip replaced at Wansbeck only 7 weeks earlier, & I can thoroughly recommend both hospitals. If you need a hip replacement Northumbria is the place to be!",0
715672,Attended for my physio sessions which I have been attending since September 2019. This was after a self-referral. Self-referral was so easy and I didn't have to wait ages for my first appointment. I called up and was called back the next day to discuss my issues. An appointment was then made for the same day. This made starting my physio so much quicker and I have been attending on a regular basis since then. I would recommend the self-referral as it is a lot quicker than waiting for my GP to refer me for the initial appointment. A great service. The service at the physio department is great. All the staff are really friendly and fully explain everything to you. ,0
716349,I was contacted last week by phone regarding a pre-op assessment for 10th December. I then received an e-mail with the details which I then e-mailed back requested another date. On Saturday I received 3 individual letters in the post 2 of which were identical. Today I received a further 4 individual letters 3 were duplicates and all printed out on 5th December. What a waste of NHS money especially when it is struggling financially. I tried to raise the issue with the Out Patient Department but haven't received a callback from the Manager. Really disappointed and ashamed that I work for the NHS. ,0
719225,"Communication with patients has not been a strength. Test results not rung through, changes of doctor not given, and length of time waiting to get through on the phone (if you can get through) or in the reception area. The doctors are very good though (ones I've seen) and the locum I had was extremely good. The nurses are also really nice and friendly. The overall atmosphere there is very average and reception staff seem unhappy. Booking online for an appointment takes weeks, so has to be an emergency to get seen quickly. All of the above is perhaps symptomatic of the state of the NHS right now. ",0
721180,"My dad was admitted to this hospital on 2 ocasions,unfortunately dad passed away in August 2019,Dad was a palliative care patient and was dying of mutiple myleoma..He died with no dignity or respect on a ward with patients ,nurses were laughing and giggling at reception,there was no compassion or careing as far as me and the family are concerned.The last 2 days of his life was awful,i feel that this hospital was totally uncaring,it broke my heart to see dad suffer the way he did..Even now i still re play the way dad was treated or should i say not treated,i refused to leave the hospital and stay at my dads side for the last 2 days he had left,i did not trust or have faith in the nurses looking after him,so i made sure i stayed til the end..",1
