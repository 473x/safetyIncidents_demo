This team is world class and we really do appreciate we are receiving the best care, advice and support. To ease the burden on travel the Guy's team is enabling us to visit Royal Surrey haematology an equally impressive department. We are particularly impressed by the end-to-end support not just from the technical team but from the support staff who are always helpful and keep us informed with either email, phone or text messaging. People are frequently quick to be critical but VERY slow to highlight the exceptional care they receive. In writing this note we are striving to re-dress the balance in favour of the positive. Thank you so much.\n",

    "My sister was admitted today, Sat 5th April, with severe back and chest pain. When the Triarge nurse came to assess her, she was in acute pain and couldn't breath. My sister's pain and anguish obviously irritated her and she threw her sheet down and said she would return when my sister calmed down! What arrogance! My sister was extremely distressed, had difficulty getting her breath and was very frightened. She was then left for 1 1/4 hours before she returned. I would like to say, that her arrogance could have well cost my sister her life. My sister, was later, that day diagnosed with pneumonia & and a blood clot on her lung. I am still seething with anger and intend to make an official complaint.\n",

The treatment I received, both medical & personal, was excellent with nothing being too much trouble for the staff, also I couldn't fault the food with a good choice of tasty items served by helpful staff. The cleaners & the porters should also be mentioned, carrying out their work efficiently & with a smile. I have already called in & left a few small tokens of my appreciation for the staff concerned ( I hope they were enjoyed ! ). So from my viewpoint no complaints at all, great service & long may it continue !!\n",
